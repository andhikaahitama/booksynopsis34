<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://bookdownloadpagehere.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Germany: The Long Road West: Volume 2: 1933-1990</h2><p>Vivid, succinct, and highly accessible, Heinrich Winkler's magisterial history of modern Germany offers the history of a nation and its people through two turbulent centuries. It is the story of a country that, while always culturally identified with the West, long resisted the political trajectories of its neighbors.<br><br>This first volume (of two) begins with the origins and consequences of the medieval myth of the "Reich," which was to experience a fateful renaissance in the twentieth century, and ends with the collapse of the first German democracy. Winkler offers a brilliant synthesis of complex events and illuminates them with fresh insights. He analyses the decisions that shaped the country's triumphs and catastrophes, interweaving high politics with telling vignettes about the German people and their own self-perception.<br><br>With a second volume that takes the story up to reunification in 1990, <em>Germany: The Long Road West</em> will be welcomed by scholars, students, and anyone wishing to understand this most complex and contradictory of countries.<br></p><p><br><strong>Heinrich August Winkler</strong> was born in 1938 in K�nigsberg. He studied history, philosophy, and public law in T�bingen, Heidelberg and M�nster. He was associate professor at the Freie Universit�t in Berlin in 1970-72 and then professor of modern history in Freiburg until 1991.

The man is Odysseus &#x2015; trickster, warrior, captain, and king &#x2015; and the <i>Odyssey</i> is his tale. This magnificent Calla edition features the 1873 verse translation&nbsp;of the ancient classic by poet William Cullen Bryant. Sixteen&nbsp;full-color plates by artist N. C. Wyeth,&nbsp;originally created for a 1929 edition, are now presented for&nbsp;the first time in conjunction with&nbsp;a verse translation of Homer's epic poem.</p><p>Both the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey</i> are attributed to Homer, the first and greatest of the Greek poets. Homer's biographical dates are a matter of conjecture, as is his actual existence. Legend characterizes him as a blind minstrel who wandered Greece, singing&nbsp;his epic poems in the ancient oral tradition.<br>American artist and illustrator Newell Convers Wyeth (1882&#x2013;1945) was a student of Howard Pyle. He created more than 3,000 paintings and illustrated more than 100 books. His home and studio in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, are designated as a National Historic Landmark.<br>American poet William Cullen Bryant (1794&#x2013;1878) was also a lawyer,&nbsp;journalist, and long-time editor of the <i>New-York Evening&nbsp;Post.</i> He studied both Greek and Latin in his youth, and in his old age he revisited his love of the classics to write blank-verse translations of both the <i>Iliad</i> and the <i>Odyssey.</i></p><h2>Expressive Writing Levels 1 &amp; 2 - Additional Teacher's Guide by Siegfried Engelmann and Jerry Silbert (2005) Paperback</h2><p>This book provides your students with instruction and practice in the basic writing skills they need in school.</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>Mind and Brain: Readings from Scientific American Magazine</h2><p>Synopsis: Provides an authoritative and accessible overview of the relationship between mind and brain.

A father and his three sons unite and unravel, both aware of and undone by privilege and its pressure.

Strikingly observant and curiously drawn, Lee departs from her experimental style to create a naturalistic observation of the most socially unobstructed of our species, the straight white male.</p><p><b>Young Jean Lee </b>has been hailed as "one of the best experimental playwrights in America" by <i>Time Out New York</i>.

Though many see it as a social and political problem grounded in unequal gender roles, this level of analysis fails to explain adequately why many battered women return to their abusers despite intense suffering and the certainty of more physical violence.<br><br><i>The Illusion of Love</i> challenges the prevailing model, which views the victim of abuse as a normal woman who is unable to escape from her batterer due to the effects of terror and psychological collapse. Instead, David Celani offers a new answer&#x2015;that women who are battered have a fundamental attraction to partners who are abusive. <br><br>Based on his years of clinical experience treating battered women, Celani applies object relations theory and case examples from his own practice to show that many women&#x2015;and indeed some men&#x2015;are unconsciously drawn to abusive partners because of personality disorders caused by childhood abuse and neglect. He argues that any effective treatment for battered women must help unravel futile and self-defeating patterns, such as ones that spring from fears of abandonment and fascination with men who produce exaggerated promises of love followed by extreme rejecting behaviors.<br><br><i>The Illusion of Love</i> examines the personalities of abusers as well, many of whom suffer from narcissism, a disorder that is also often associated with childhood abuse and neglect. Narcissistic men lash out violently in an attempt to control their own fears or abandonment and to compensate for unsatisfied emotional needs. <br><br>Celani concludes that domestic violence is often the tragic result of a union between individuals with complementary personality disorders. His findings fly in the face of the politically correct refusal to examine the behavior of the victim of abuse, a strategy that has led to a severe misunderstanding of the dynamics of the battering scenario. <i>The Illusion of Love</i> calls for primary prevention of neglectful parenting to stem the tide of abuse in the future, offering tangible hope for the treatment of victims of abuse as they attempt to extricate themselves from unhealthy, damaging relationships.</p><p>Examines the attraction between abuser and victim which results in disorders and dangerous attractions on both sides, considering the typical personalities involved in patterns of neglect.&#39;For clinical psychologist Celani, Fairbairn&#39;s object relations theory is the key: he argues that battered and battering spouses manifest complementary personality disorders, both in response to neglectful, rejecting parents. Because abuser and abused failed to achieve differentiation, introjection, and integration in childhood, both seek love from--and fear loss of--an adult partner who is as incapable of meeting their needs as their parents were.&#39; -- Booklist</p><h2>Psychotherapy East and West</h2><p>Psychotherapy meets spirituality in this unique work which compares the worldview and methods of the yogic sages with modem psychotherapists. In the ancient system of yoga, the sages studied the psyche scientifically, developing techniques to lead their students through mental barriers to the reality beyond the mind. Students learned through direct experience, by practicing the methods taught by their teachers. Modern psychotherapists also help the individual to know himself, but this young science only goes part of the way, each school emphasizing a different aspect of human functioning. In Psychotherapy East and West practical methods are described for helping people change and attain a higher state of consciousness. The spiritual aspects of psychotherapy are clearly explained, and yogic techniques are provided for bodywork, breathwork, working with habit patterns, self-observation, and spiritual practices such as silence.</p><p>Swami Ajaya has the unique distinction of being both a clinical psychologist and a swami. He was educated at Wesleyan University and the University of California at Berkeley, where he received a Ph.D. in psychology. After serving as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Wisconsin Department of Psychiatry and teaching at the University, he traveled and studied with various sages of India. He currently has psychotherapy centers as well as yoga meditation centers in the US."...unique and outstanding, ... it relates the sophisticated science of Eastern psychology and psychotherapy to the techniques of Western psychology and psychotherapy." -- <i>a</i><br><br>"This book is unique and outstanding, for it relates the sophisticated science of Eastern psychology and psychotherapy to the techniques of Western psychology and psychotherapy." -- <i>International Psychologist</i></p><h2>Pigment Compendium: A Dictionary and Optical Microscopy of Historic Pigments (Routledge Series in Conservation and Museology)</h2><p>This is an essential purchase for all painting conservators and conservation scientists dealing with paintings and painted objects.

The answer depends upon your library's audience. The Hammond has a slightly higher percentage of maps of North America, the Oxford of Europe. The Hammond devotes more space to matters like "interpreting maps"; the Oxford has more pages of indexes plus a 32-page section of city maps. The Hammond atlas is the first such atlas to be generated completely from computer databases (it took five years and $5 million); the Oxford depends on the tried-and-true skills of the George Philip Group. The Oxford shows relief by hypsometric tints, the Hammond by color, shaded relief, and spot heights. They are both good buys, so if your users are oriented toward the United States and your map library has a good collection of large-city maps, try the Hammond; if Euro-centered, buy Oxford.<br><i>- Mary L.

Patients complain that physicians are too detached. Halpern argues that by empathizing with patients, rather than detaching, physicians can best help them. Yet there is no consistent view of what, precisely, clinical empathy involves. This book challenges the traditional assumption that empathy is either purely intellectual or an expression of sympathy. Sympathy, according to many physicians, involves over-identifying with patients, threatening objectivity and respect for patient autonomy. <br><br>How can doctors use empathy in diagnosing and treating patients rithout jeopardizing objectivity or projecting their values onto patients? Jodi Halpern, a psychiatrist, medical ethicist and philosopher, develops a groundbreaking account of emotional reasoning as the core of clinical empathy. She argues that empathy cannot be based on detached reasoning because it involves emotional skills, including associating with another person's images and spontaneously following another's mood shifts. Yet she argues that these emotional links need not lead to over-identifying with patients or other lapses in rationality but rather can inform medical judgement in ways that detached reasoning cannot. For reflective physicians and discerning patients, this book provides a road map for cultivating empathy in medical practice. For a more general audience, it addresses a basic human question: how can one person's emotions lead to an understanding of how another person is feeling?<br></p><p><br><strong>Jodi Halpern</strong>, M.D., Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Bioethics and Medical Humanitites at the University of California, Berkeley. She received her B.A., M.D. and Ph.D. in philosophy from Yale University, did an internship at the UCLA/Wadsworth VA Medical Centers, and completed a residency in psychiatry at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Institute. She won the Louis Nahum Prize for her medical school thesis, and her Ph.D. thesis was awarded the Porter Prize, which is given to the outstanding dissertation at Yale of general interest across the disciplines.<br>"This book argues that by allowing patients to move them [emotionally], physicians gain access to a source of understanding illness and suffering that can make them more effective healers." By the beginning of the 21st century, this statement, which opens the preface of Halpern's book, should be inarguable. Instead, it remains controversial. Virtually all medical students, when confronted by the very sick, are moved by their patients' plight. They often feel so connected to their patients that they begin to have symptoms similar to theirs or experience painful loss at their deaths. These reactions to sadness, tragedy, and loss continue into the postgraduate years and beyond. Seeking help for their distress, students and physicians-in-training are too often advised "not to get involved," not to let their emotions or their attachment to patients carry them away. This useless idea, in one form or another, dates back a long time. It is uncommon for teachers to tell students exactly how to manage these emotions -- where, after all, would they themselves have learned to do so? Consequently, physicians generally gravitate to one of three mechanisms. They may deny that the patient (or his or her family) is having the emotion to which the physician might otherwise react; they may feel the emotion and interiorize it, not letting anyone else know how bad they feel; or they may detach themselves from their own emotional reaction, acknowledging the patient's difficulty but not their own response. Halpern, a psychiatrist and philosopher, chooses to examine the third response and rejects the commonly offered arguments for its usefulness. "We can reject the arguments that attempt to justify detachment as an overall stance to prevent burn-out, permit effective technique, and promote impartiality," she writes. She wants instead to focus on "the most basic argument physicians give for maintaining detachment: emotions are inherently subjective influences that interfere with objectivity." Halpern is correct in stating that the history of medicine over the past almost 200 years has been occupied with a search for increasing scientific objectivity -- a focus that has been intensified in recent decades by the success of medical science in understanding pathophysiology. The domain of the personal, where emotions have their effect, is irreducibly subjective. It is these subjective facts of the lives of patients that modify the presentation of diseases and their diagnosis and treatment. Failure to respond to the emotion that attends sickness leads to errors in diagnosis and treatment and to failure to understand and treat suffering. Unfortunately, it is impossible to banish emotions from medicine, because both physicians and patients are people, and emotions are as much a part of people as thought. Halpern points out that from the perspective of the objective domain of medicine, "emotions are seen as impinging on medical judgments in two distinct ways. First, certain emotional states are seen as disruptive to thinking. For example, if a physician became very angry he might have trouble concentrating. Second, and more fundamentally, even calm emotions are seen as unreliable sources of information." A large portion of the book is given over to alternative views of the problems posed to thought by the emotions. In ancient Greece, the emotions or "passions" were seen as opposed to reason. Reason, in this view, is a mental faculty distinguished from the emotions, sensation, and will. Philosophers continue to argue about what reason actually is or does. In dealing with everyday life, we are better off considering thought and how it acts in bringing together information and forming it into propositions -- statements that can be assembled in logical steps toward a judgment or a conclusion. It makes no difference to logical thought what material it has to work on; it does equally well with the factual, the mystical, the irrational, and the biochemical. So when Halpern explains repeatedly that emotions are irrational -- a common view dating back to Plato -- it is not very useful. What are we to think about (or with) the emotions that Halpern wants us to attend to if they have no logical basis -- especially given the fact that all meanings, the concepts we use to interpret the world, objects, events, relationships, people, and circumstances, include emotions along with their cognitive content? There is increasing evidence to suggest that emotions are evaluative in nature (see, for example, Martha Nussbaum's recent encyclopedic Upheavals of Thought [Cambridge, United Kingdom: Cambridge University Press, 2001]). Far from "irrational," they are a kind of facts generated by reactions to the world -- a perfectly reasonable substrate for thought. The cognitive response "I have cancer," for example, plus the emotional response of dread, register what a thing is and our evaluation of it. For those taking care of patients, knowledge of not only the brute facts that they relate about their illness but also the emotions that those facts generate within them gives insight into where patients stand in relation to the illness. The emotions that patients arouse within physicians are also evaluative and tell physicians much about the patients, about themselves, and about their relationship. The best chapter in the book discusses the concept, meanings, uses, and achievement of clinical empathy. Halpern's review of various ways of understanding empathy is very useful. Rejecting the models of affective merging (which is common among psychoanalysts) and detached insight, she develops her own theory that empathy is emotional reasoning. According to this view, the "empathizer is able to resonate emotionally with, yet stay aware of, what is distinct about the patient's experience." This model requires one to have the ability to imagine how it feels to experience something. Experience suggests, however, that no one model of empathy is sufficient. What is needed is the desire to share the patient's experience or emotion; if that desire is present, whatever tools one has at hand -- affective merging, insight from past experience, extremely close attention to the patient, imaginative participation in the patient's experience, anything that seems helpful -- will do the job. At the same time, the physician must always remember, as a protection against the sometimes threatening closeness of empathy, that he or she is a physician working. Even when physicians are at their most empathetic, it is not the same as being among family members or close friends: they are still being physicians. This chapter is worth reading. Overall, this is an important book. I recommend it to physicians and members of medical faculties for whom its subject matter is important. It is a serious essay on subjectivity, a topic about which we will be seeing more in the coming years. It repays the work of reading it. <i>Eric Cassell, M.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2002 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

This is the first volume to bring together their engagements with his drama, which are part of an underexplored philosophical tradition. <i>Philosophers on Shakespeare</i> comes at a time when the critical paradigm of Shakespeare studies in the academy is shifting from a historicist and cultural materialist model toward a renewed interest in theoretical readings of the plays. Shakespeare's work is currently being taught and performed more than ever, and there is a proliferation of new critical editions of the plays themselves to which this volume will serve as a timely and much-needed companion. It is useful for the light it sheds on individual plays as well as for its survey of literary criticism, aesthetic theory, theories of tragedy and dramatic criticism since the mid-eighteenth century.</p></p><p>Paul A. Kottman is Assistant Professor of Comparative Literature at the New School, where he teaches at Eugene Lang College, the New School for Liberal Arts, and in Liberal Studies at the New School for Social Research. He is the author of <i>A Politics of the Scene</i> (Stanford, 2008) and <i>Tragic Conditions in Shakespeare</i> (2009)."This is a timely, thoughtful, and well-conceived project that gives readers a strong sampling of philosophical approaches to Shakespeare. One of Kottman's gifts is his extraordinary ability to stage real questions of continuing urgency. A sense of genuine engagement and creative re-encounter with the legacy of Shakespeare runs through the selected essays, as well as Kottman's lucid, determined, and compassionate introduction." (Julia Reinhard Lupton, University of California <i>Irvine</i>)<br><br>"This unusually rich and surprising collection joins a small but important set of books that provide the primary materials for tracing Shakespeare's wider cultural influence. Kottman's ambitious book draws our attention to the role of Shakespeare and his plays in forging a crucial strain of philosophical discourse for the past two centuries." (W. B.

Unaided by money, family, or beauty, Jane relies on her intelligence and integrity to help her survive. <br>After Jane secures a position as governess in mysterious, beautiful Thornfield mansion, she becomes deeply enmeshed with her moody employer, Mr. Rochester. But Rochester guards a dark and terrible secret-a secret that will force Jane to choose between the principles that define her and the only love she has ever known.<br></p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as "the masterwork of great genius," <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.</p><h2>Swing Trading</h2><p><p>Oliver Velez, co-founder of Pristine.com and current CEO of Velez Capital Management, is renowned for his effective trading skills and specialized knowledge in technical analysis.

The closest the "Dean of American Cooking" ever came to writing an autobiography, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i> is full of insightful, entertaining stories that chronicle the development of one of America's most discerning palates. Along the way, Beard shares more than 150 recipes for sumptuous treats like scalloped clams, potato gnocchi, and much more, including many recipes from his own mother's kitchen. In the words of Julia Child, "It is a wonderful event for all lovers of good cooks and good food that <i>Delights and Prejudices</i> is with us again."</p><p>James Beard's 1964 classic, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i>, has been reprinted in a newly illustrated edition. This is wonderful news for all who love food and food writing. Erudite yet intimate, <i>Delights and Prejudices</i> is, first, the memoir-with-recipes of a great American gastronome. It's also fascinatingly panoramic on good meals taken worldwide; on ingredients as diverse as the potato and the truffle; on great food places, markets to restaurants; and on food people, from Beard's cantankerous, food-muse mother to many of the stars of the last century's food firmament, including Julia Child. This is not only Beard's greatest work but also one of the best books we have on food and what we know about it. <p> Beard's gastronomic life began in bounteous early-20th century Portland, Oregon, where his mother cooked for several hotels. An early culinary memory has the near-infant Beard relishing an onion, skin and all. From there the story captures a world of gastronomic likes and dislikes from "sensational" veal roasts to the gherkins known as cornichons, "one of the mistakes the French make in eating." Beard's love of French food is, however, usually unmitigated, matched only by his adoration of traditional, locally produced American cooking. Recipes for this fare, including clam souffl� and candied-ginger pumpkin pie, are among the 150 formulas offered, a Beardian cr�me de la cr�me that also encompasses hors d'oeuvres, breads, and cakes. The book also chronicles Beard's ascent to fame, beginning with his 1940s appearance on <i>I Love to Eat</i>, TV's first cooking show, to the arrival of his many influential cookbooks. It ends, characteristically, in his kitchen, "the place where [he] can best satisfy the eccentricities of [his] own palate." The journey makes am enthralling read. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p><b>James Beard</b> had a national reputation as an authority on every phase of food. Consultant to a wine and spirits establishment, he wrote seventy-six other books and numerous articles for national magazines on widely varied phases of cooking. Mr. Beard, who knew the cooking of every corner of our country, cooked in nearly every language. He lived abroad, traveled throughout Europe a number of times, saw most of the Western Hemisphere, and visited Hawaii and North Africa. His familiarity with exotic foreign foods spiced his extensive knowledge of American cooking at its best.<p>Mr. Beard was adviser to several large food companies, was food editor of Argosy magazine, and made many appearances on radio and television. His first three books are <i>Hors d'Oeuvres and Canapes, Cook It Outdoors,</i> and <i>Fowl and Game Cookery.</i> Equally at home in the kitchen of his own New York apartment and that of a hotel, James Beard brought the same sure touch to a half-hour supper as he did to the most elaborate buffet. He died in 1985.</p></p><h2>The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets (Oxford Companions)</h2><p>A sweet tooth is a powerful thing. Babies everywhere seem to smile when tasting sweetness for the first time, a trait inherited, perhaps, from our ancestors who foraged for sweet foods that were generally safer to eat than their bitter counterparts. But the "science of sweet" is only the beginning of a fascinating story, because it is not basic human need or simple biological impulse that prompts us to decorate elaborate wedding cakes, scoop ice cream into a cone, or drop sugar cubes into coffee. These are matters of culture and aesthetics, of history and society, and we might ask many other questions. Why do sweets feature so prominently in children's literature? When was sugar called a spice? And how did chocolate evolve from an ancient drink to a modern candy bar? <br><br>The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets explores these questions and more through the collective knowledge of 265 expert contributors, from food historians to chemists, restaurateurs to cookbook writers, neuroscientists to pastry chefs. The Companion takes readers around the globe and throughout time, affording glimpses deep into the brain as well as stratospheric flights into the world of sugar-crafted fantasies. More than just a compendium of pastries, candies, ices, preserves, and confections, this reference work reveals how the human proclivity for sweet has brought richness to our language, our art, and, of course, our gastronomy. In nearly 600 entries, beginning with "� la mode" and ending with the Italian trifle known as "zuppa inglese," the Companion traces sugar's journey from a rare luxury to a ubiquitous commodity. In between, readers will learn about numerous sweeteners (as well-known as agave nectar and as obscure as castoreum, or beaver extract), the evolution of the dessert course, the production of chocolate, and the neurological, psychological, and cultural responses to sweetness. The Companion also delves into the darker side of sugar, from its ties to colonialism and slavery to its addictive qualities. <br><br>Celebrating sugar while acknowledging its complex history, The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets is the definitive guide to one of humankind's greatest sources of pleasure. Like kids in a candy shop, fans of sugar (and aren't we all?) will enjoy perusing the wondrous variety to be found in this volume.<br></p><p><br><strong>Darra Goldstein </strong>is the Willcox and Harriet Adsit Professor of Russian at Williams College, having earned her Ph.D. in Slavic Languages and Literatures from Stanford University.

It is a must for any food, anthropology, or history enthusiast." --Pichet Ong, chef consultant and author of <em>The Sweet Spot</em><p></p><br>"The new <em>Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets</em> tempts the intellect more than the palate. It's a thick encyclopedia crammed with plenty of history, social science, physiology and culture." --Florence Fabricant, <em>New York Times</em><p></p><br>"Well-planned entries, which go into great depth, address topics such as pie, children's literature (Hansel and Gretel play their part), sour cream, Tate and Lyles golden syrup, and New Orleans and <em>Twelfth Night</em> cake, also known as king cake ...

Lawrence</h2><p>PHOENIX, one of the great works in the D. H. Lawrence bibliography, is a posthumous collection of a vast amount of Lawrence material that for many years remained either unavailable in book form or simply unpublished in any form. In this volume appear works written as early as 1912 and as late as 1930, and almost every year in between is represented with something that was unknown to the public. The material contained in PHOENIX is as intense, diverse, wide, and original as Lawrence&#39;s mind and interests. Included are essays, sketches, and critical studies on such topics as nature; peoples, countries, and races; love, sex, men, and women; ethics, psychology, and philosophy; literature and art, including a book-length study of Thomas Hardy; popular education; and Lawrence&#39;s contemporaries. Edward D. McDonald, Lawrence&#39;s American bibliographer, has selected and arranged the material and provided the book with an illuminating Introduction. To students and admirers of Lawrence, PHOENIX is a fascinating and essential addition to their knowledge of Lawrence&#39;s mind and his work.</p><p></p><h2>Operations &amp; Process Management</h2><p>Written by best-selling authors in their field, the Fourth Edition of Operations and Process Management inspires a critical and applied mastery of the core principles and process which are fundamental to successfully managing business operations.

To what extent has the mass culture of the movie industry itself been conceptually shaped by a broad, external societal discourse? Norman Denzin brings to his life-long study of alcoholism a searching interest in how cultural texts signify and lend themselves to interpretation within a social nexus. Both historical and diachronic in his approach, Denzin identifies five periods in the alcoholism films made between 1932 and the end of the 1980s, and offers a detailed critical reading of thirty-seven films produced during these six decades.</p></p><p><p><em>Norman K. Denzin </em>is professor of sociology, cinema studies, and interpretive theory at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. He was awarded the George Herbert Mead Award for Lifetime Achievement from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. He is the author of several books, including <em>The Alcoholic Society, Children and Their Caretakers, Hollywood Shot by Shot, Sociological Methods,</em> and <em>The Values of Social Science</em>.</p><p> "Denzin has gone on an exhaustive bar-crawl through hundreds of movies, returning with evidence that the film about drinking is a genre of its own. He writes from sound knowledge about alcoholism--which, unlike other diseases, is frequently viewed with bittersweet romanticism."</p> <p> <em>&#x2014;</em>Roger Ebert</p> <p> "Professor Denzin has produced a searching and provocative interpretation of more than a half-century of Hollywood's social and personal construction of the problem drinker in America. Readable by both lay persons and specialists, Denzin's book provides us with the most comprehensive understanding of this topic to date."</p> <p> <em>&#x2014;</em>Stanford M. Lyman, Robert J. Morrow Eminent Scholar in Social Science, Florida Atlantic University</p> <p> "An eminent sociologist and leading authority on alcoholism, Denzin also writes skillfully about films as films and is comfortable with postmodern interpretive theory�a <i>genuinely</i> interdisciplinary work of the first order."</p> <p> <em>&#x2014;</em>Robert L. Carringer, author, <i>The Making of Citizen Kane</i></p> <p> &#x201c;Denzin is a sociologist whose specialty is alcoholism and who has an interest in social psychology. His treatment of the alcoholic in American movies is informed by theories of symbolic interactionism and deconstructionism... It will most likely appeal to sociologists and film critics because of its extensive references, filmography, and bibliography.&#x201d;</p> <p> <em>&#x2014;</em>D. W. Hoover, <em>Choice</em></p></p><h2>Leopardi</h2><p>These translations of the major poems of Giacomo Leopardi (1798-1837) render into modern English verse the work of a writer who is widely regarded as the greatest lyric poet in the Italian literary tradition. In spite of this reputation, and in spite of a number of nineteenth-and twentieth-century translations, Leopardi&#39;s poems have never &#34;come over&#34; into English in such a way as to guarantee their author a recognition comparable to that of other great European Romantic poets. By catching something of Leopardi&#39;s cadences and tonality in a version that still reads as idiomatic modern English (with an occasional Irish or American accent), Leopardi: Selected Poems should win for the Italian poet the wider appreciative audience he deserves. His themes are mutability, landscape, love; his attitude, one of unflinching realism in the face of unavoidable human loss. But the manners of the poems are a unique amalgam of philosophical toughness and the lyrically bittersweet. In a way more pure and distilled than most others in the Western tradition, these poems are truly what Matthew Arnold asked all poetry to be, a &#34;criticism of life&#34; The translator&#39;s aim is to convey something of the profundity and something of the sheer poetic achievement of Leopardi&#39;s inestimable Canti.</p><p>By general consensus, Giacomo Leopardi is the greatest Italian poet since Dante. His influence on the major Italian poets who come after him--Montale, Ungaretti, and Pavese--is indisputable. Yet he's not well known to English speakers, largely because his work has resisted translation. That's why this fine new version of <i>Selected Poems</i> is particularly welcome. The Irish poet Eamon Grennan has managed to clear away the cobwebs, judiciously employing a loose blank verse reminiscent of Wordsworth and Coleridge. Along with capturing the lyrical fluidity of Leopardi's rhythms, Grennan reminds us that a poem like "The Solitary Thrush" is exactly contemporary with Keats's "Ode to a Nightingale"--and that Leopardi is more acid than the Romantics ever were: <blockquote> You'll not grieve, surely,<br> For the life you've led, since even<br> The slightest twist of your will<br> Is nature's way. But to me,<br> If I fail to escape<br> Loathsome old age--<br> When these eyes will mean nothing<br> To any other heart, the world be nothing<br> But a blank to them,<br> Each day more desolate, every day<br> Darker than the one before--what then<br> Will this longing for solitude<br> Seem like to me? What then<br> Will these years, or even I myself,<br> Seem to have been? Alas,<br> I'll be sick with regret, and over and over,<br> But inconsolable, looking back.<br> </blockquote> Just as Hamlet leaps out of the Middle Ages into the Renaissance, Leopardi (who died in 1837) ceases to accept the consolations of the Enlightenment. Refusing to find a fixed center of the universe, he admits to the presence of the void. No poet before him so actively conveys the force of <i>nothing</i>: "Tomorrow the hours will be leaden / With emptiness and melancholy." Indeed, the recognition of such metaphysical boredom, which the Italians call <i>la noia</i>, strikes Leopardi as the very badge of humanity: "To suffer want, emptiness, and hence <i>noia</i>--this seems to me the chief sign of the grandeur and nobility of human nature." <i>--Mark Rudman</i><b>Eamon Grennan</b> has published three collections of poetry: <i>What Light There Is &amp; Other Poems</i>, <i>As If It Matters</i>, and <i>So It Goes</i>.

The book&#39;s new organization emphasizes the generic nature of engineering materials in phenomenon and function and acknowledges traditional classes of materials in the process. Coverage of frontier areas have been added including: toughened ceramics, new polymers, high-temperature superconductors, superhard magnets, and other fiber-optic glasses.</p><p><p>No course in science or engineering may remain static. Not only does technology advance and scientific understanding increase, the academic framework undergoes changes. Thus, periodic revisions are desirable in an effort to optimize the value of a textbook for students who will be tomorrow's engineers. </p><p>Developments such as the high-temperature superconductors are exciting, and the scientific data such as that obtained from tunneling electron microscopes provide new insights. During the last decade, however, the evolving structure of the academic environment probably has had a more direct impact on introductory materials courses within the engineering curricula. Whereas academic departments will continue to have specialists in ceramics, in polymers, as well as to hybrid composites. Likewise, graduate students working with polyblends give cognizance to phase immiscibilities and to the microstructure/property relationships utilized by ceramists and metallurgists. Particulate processing is no longer restricted to ceramics, nor are engineering designs using magnets limited to metallic materials. </p><p>In view of these changes, the majority of the current generation of instructors can easily extend the topics of crystals from single-component metals to binary ceramic compounds, and even introduce simple molecular crystals when they tech an introductory materials course. Likewise, although reaction rates may differ, the same principles hold for the phase relationships of ceramics and polymers as they do for metals. Today's instructor easily handles these topics generically for the several types of materials. </p><p>The major modification to this edition has been in the attention to the commonality found within the materials field, in which structures and properties are considered generically for all materials rather than categorically by material classes--metals, polymers, ceramics, and semiconducters. The three photos present on the cover and chapters this sixth edition are symbolic of this generic view; each chosen to pictorially demonstrate the connection between structure, properties, and performance. Overview </p><p>Chapter 1 remains as an introduction to the topic of materials, since undergraduate students generally relate to their product without giving thought to the materials within them. Chapter 2 reviews the necessary chemistry from the students' previous general chemistry courses, but in doing so extends the topics of bonding and atomic coordination. The topics of Chapters 3, 4, and 5 are common to all materials--crystal structure, disorder in solids, and phase relationships, respectively. Included for the first time in Chapter 5 are several molecular phase diagrams, chosen to emphasize immiscibility, which is pertinent to the more recently developed polyblends. </p><p>Chapter 6 combines and extends the subject of reaction rates, while Chapter 7 does the same for an introduction to microstructure. Although the three principal classes of materials have distinct differences with respect to these two topics, the bases of the differences are instructive to the subject; for example, the crystallization rates of metallic, silicate, and polymeric materials. </p><p>Chapters 8, 9, and 10 focus on the mechanical behavior of solids. In sequence, they consider deformation, strengthening, and the characteristics of polymers and composites. Chapters 11, 12, and 13 look at the electromagnetic behavior of solids--conductivity, magnetic, and the dielectric and optical, respectively. These six chapters are written to give the instructor options regarding the topics to be selected, depending on the available time and curricular requirements. </p><p>The final chapter (14) addresses performance in service, particularly for severe conditions in which corrosion, fatigue, heat, or radiation may alter the structure and hence the properties of materials. Pedagogy </p><p>Teaching aids within the text include not only the Summary at the end of each chapter, but also nearly 175 Examples in which a procedure is outlined before the calculations are made. Wherever appropriate, followup comments supplement the calculations. Practice Problems at the end of each chapter offer a trial run for the student, and answers to these several hundred problems are available at the end of the text. A new end-of-chapter feature is the inclusion of Test Problems. Of the nearly 400 such problems throughout the book, the majority either are new to the text or are significantly modified from those in previous editions. More than 400 Terms and Concepts are defined in a glossary. Supplementary Material </p><p>A study Guide that accompanies the text is available for students' use with this edition. It provides both a means for self-instruction when desired, or facilitates self-help for a lagging student. The Study Guide contains Quiz Samples (and their answers) as well as expanded solutions to the Practice Problems of the text. Also included are the more widely used study sets that appeared in Study Aids for Introductory Materials Courses. These visual aids, revised as necessary, have proven their merit in previous years in not having to delay class progress for those individuals who are not immediately clear on crystal structures, phase diagrams, diffusion, or other basic concepts. Acknowledgments </p><p>It is with regret that I can not cite each and every individual who has contributed to the updating of this text. The list would include literally hundreds of students at The University of Michigan who have given feedback on assigned topics and study problems. The critical comments and suggestions of my academic colleagues in Ann Arbor have been most welcome and helpful. Likewise, academic associates in other materials science and engineering departments deserve recognition for both letters and personal discussions in regard to content and possible improvements. </p><p>The role of Professors Morris Cohen (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Richard Porter (North Carolina State), and Ronald Gibala (University of Michigan) should be specifically acknowledged. Each critiqued the contents of this new edition in detail and provided an assurance of appropriateness of the changes. On the publishing side, I want to thank Don Fowley, Bette Aaronson, and all of the Addison-Wesley personnel for their attention to the multitude of editing and production details that lead to a quality product. </p><p>Finally, and most importantly, none of the revision efforts would have been possible without my wife Fran's patience and tolerance during recent months. </p><p>Ann Arbor, Michigan<br> L.H.V.V.</p></p><h2>Combination Challenge</h2><p>&#34;Attaining the Master-Expert Levels in chess through Tactics&#34; This classic contains 1154 striking examples of chess combinations PLUS a training method for learning chess tactics.</p><p>Thousands of chess players have improved their game using Combination Challenge!

Born in Mexico in 1953, Chagoya taps his home country's complex history, international politics, world religions, art history and popular culture in lively paintings, drawings, codices and prints. His varied oeuvre includes social satire and his trademark "reverse anthropology"--the imaginative retelling of various histories from the point of view of the defeated. Chagoya's fantastical narratives combine contemporary icons like Mickey Mouse, Superman, Che Guevara and George W. Bush with ancient figures like the Aztec god Mictlantecutli, Buddha, the Virgin of Guadalupe and Jesus Christ. This remarkable survey offers a comprehensive presentation of the artist's work from 1983 to 2007, and features bi-lingual--English and Spanish--texts by Jeff Fleming, Patricia Hickson, Daniela Perez and Robert Storr, alongside a checklist, an artist's chronology and selected exhibition history. Among the 63 color illustrations are several three-panel foldout sheets featuring Chagoya's codices--accordion-folded books on amate (bark) paper drawn from pre-Columbian tradition.</p><p>&#34;Jeff Fleming is Director of the Des Moines Art Center.

It surveys social, economic, political, cultural and diplomatic developments in an age of tumultuous upheaval. It also explains why historians have so often reversed the interpretative &#39;switches&#39; guiding research on this period. By highlighting the breadth of historical change under Wilhelm II and the evolution of opposing viewpoints about its significance, this book provides easy access to an epoch - and a debate - characterised more by controversy than consensus.</p><p></p><h2>Journeys: Benchmark and Unit Tests Teacher&#39;s Edition Grade 2 Grade 2</h2><p>Journeys: Common Core Benchmark and Unit Tests Teacher&#39;s Edition Grade 2 [Paperback]..

But the admissions policies of elite universities have long been both tightly controlled and shrouded in secrecy. In The Chosen, the Berkeley sociologist Jerome Karabel lifts the veil on a century of admission and exclusion at Harvard, Yale, and Princeton. How did the policies of our elite schools evolve? Whom have they let in and why? And what do those policies say about America? <br><br>A grand narrative brimming with insights, The Chosen provides a lens through which to examine some of the main events and movements of America in the twentieth century&#x2014;from immigration restriction and the Great Depression to the dropping of the atomic bomb and the launching of Sputnik, from the Cold War to the triumph of the market ethos.<br><br>Many of Karabel&#x2019;s findings are astonishing: the admission of blacks into the Ivy League wasn&#x2019;t an idealistic response to the civil rights movement but a fearful reaction to inner-city riots; Yale and Princeton decided to accept women only after realizing that they were losing men to colleges (such as Harvard and Stanford) that had begun accepting &#x201c;the second sex&#x201d;; Harvard had a systematic quota on &#x201c;intellectuals&#x201d; until quite recently; and discrimination against Asian Americans in the 1980s mirrored the treatment of Jews earlier in the century.<br><br>Drawing on decades of meticulous research, Karabel shines a light on the ever-changing definition of &#x201c;merit&#x201d; in college admissions, showing how it shaped&#x2014;and was shaped by&#x2014;the country at large. Full of colorful characters, from FDR and Woodrow Wilson to Kingman Brewster and Archibald Cox, The Chosen charts the century-long battle over opportunity&#x2014;and offers a new and deeply original perspective on American history.</p><p>JEROME KARABEL is a professor of sociology at the University of California, Berkeley, and a senior fellow of the Longview Institute, a new progressive think tank.

Though neither a brilliant <br>scholar nor a talented athlete, the young man had a certain charisma about <br>him &#x2014; a classmate later described him as "gray-eyed, cool, self-possessed, <br>intelligent . . . [with] the warmest, most friendly, and understanding smile."1 <br>The freshman had been given a strong recommendation from his Latin <br>teacher, who described him as "a fellow of exceptional ability and high <br>character" who "hopes to go into public life."2 His name was Franklin Delano <br>Roosevelt, and in 1933 he became the fourth graduate of Harvard College to <br>serve as president of the United States.<br> Franklin's acceptance at Harvard had been taken for granted. <br>Having attended Groton, the most socially elite of America's boarding <br>schools, he was sure to be admitted to Harvard; in 1900, 18 of his Groton <br>classmates (out of a class of just 23) joined him in Cambridge.3 There the <br>Groton boys &#x2014; along with their peers from St. Paul's, St. Mark's, Milton, and <br>other leading private schools &#x2014; dominated the upper reaches of campus life.<br> Even then, however, the children of the elite did not constitute the <br>entire freshman class. Harvard, far more than Yale and especially Princeton, <br>took pride in the diversity of its student body. In his address to new students, <br>President Charles W. Eliot denounced as a "common error" the supposition <br>that "the men of the University live in rooms the walls of which are covered <br>with embossed leather." The truth, Eliot insisted, was quite the contrary: "the <br>majority are of moderate means; and it is this diversity of condition that <br>makes the experience of meeting men here so valuable."4<br> Though Eliot was downplaying the heavy representation of children <br>of privilege at Harvard, there was in fact a surprising degree of heterogeneity <br>among the students. More than 40 percent of Roosevelt's freshman class <br>came from public schools, and many were the children of immigrants.5 And <br>of Harvard's leading feeder schools, the top position in 1900 was occupied <br>not by Groton or St. Paul's (18 students) but by Boston Latin (38 students), <br>a public institution that had long since lost its cachet as a school for the <br>sons of Boston Brahmins.6<br> Yet the Harvard attended by public school boys was separated <br>from the Harvard of Roosevelt and his friends by a vast social chasm. Its <br>physical symbol was the divide between Mount Auburn Street's <br>luxurious "Gold Coast, where the patrician students lived," and the shabby <br>dormitories of Harvard Yard, some of which lacked central heating and <br>plumbing above the basement, where the more plebeian students stayed.7 <br>Roosevelt was, by birth, a natural member of the Mount Auburn group; even <br>before he enrolled at Harvard, he visited Cambridge with his future roommate, <br>Lathrop Brown, to select a suitable spot on the Gold Coast. Their choice was <br>Westmorly Court (now part of Adams House), an elegant structure that <br>provided the young men with a high-ceilinged suite complete with two <br>bedrooms, a sitting room, an entrance hall, and a bath.8<br> As the scion of a prominent family with long Harvard ties &#x2014; his <br>father, James, had graduated from Harvard Law School in 1851, and his <br>distant cousin Theodore, then running for vice president of the United States, <br>graduated from the college in 1880 &#x2014; Roosevelt fit smoothly into the Gold <br>Coast atmosphere. Though he had pledged to make a "a large acquaintance" <br>at Harvard, young Franklin remained firmly within his milieu of origin. Taking <br>his daily meals at an all-Groton table in a private dining hall, he spent many <br>of his evenings at Sanborn's billiard and tobacco parlor, where he could <br>meet "most of the Groton, St. M[ark's], St. Paul's and Pomfret fellows. "He <br>was also a regular on the Boston social circuit, attending teas, dinners, and <br>debutante parties.9<br> Though Roosevelt's distinguished lineage guaranteed him a <br>certain social success, it did not free him from the need to compete for a <br>place in Harvard's rich and highly stratified extracurricular life &#x2014; a realm of <br>energetic activity that occupied a far more central place in the lives of most <br>students than their studies. Occupying the apex of the extracurriculum at <br>turn-of-the-century Harvard was football, and Roosevelt dutifully went out for <br>the team. He was joined by 142 other students &#x2014; well over a quarter of the <br>entering class.10 Trying out for the position of end, he stood 6'1" but weighed <br>just 146 pounds. On October 13, 1900, Roosevelt &#x2014; who had been a <br>mediocre, if eager, football player at Groton &#x2014; was notified that he had failed <br>to make the team.11<br> Within days of being cut, Roosevelt decided to try his hand at <br>another prestigious activity &#x2014; the Crimson, Harvard's student newspaper. On <br>October 19, he wrote to his parents, informing them that he was trying out for <br>the newspaper and expressing the hope that "if I work hard for two years I <br>may be made an editor."12 But at the Crimson, as in football, he did not <br>survive the fierce competition; vying for a slot among 86 candidates, he was <br>passed over when the first crop of freshman was selected in February.13<br> Yet Roosevelt persisted in his efforts to make the paper, scoring a <br>coup in April when his cousin Theodore, by then the vice president, visited <br>Cambridge and told him that he would be lecturing the following morning in <br>Professor Lowell's class in constitutional government. Franklin broke the <br>story in the Crimson, and the following morning a crowd of 2,000 was milling <br>about in front of Sanders Theatre, trying to attend the lecture. From this point <br>on, Roosevelt's star began to rise, and in the autumn of 1902, he became the <br>Crimson's assistant managing editor.14<br> As Roosevelt advanced at the Crimson, his success owed more <br>to his doggedness than his journalistic talent, for he was an unremarkable <br>writer. His family name was perhaps his greatest asset; in September 1901, <br>after the assassination of William McKinley, Cousin Teddy became president <br>of the United States. In Franklin's February 1903 campaign for managing <br>editor (a position that led automatically to the presidency), a poster <br>read: "For Managing Editor &#x2014; Cousin Frank &#x2014; the Fairest of the Roosevelts." <br>Roosevelt won the election, ultimately serving as president of the Crimson <br>from June to December of 1903.15<br> The Crimson valued hard work and talent, yet some of the same <br>social cleavages that divided the campus were nevertheless visible. <br>Remembering his days on the newspaper, Roosevelt's classmate Walter E. <br>Sachs, later of the Goldman Sachs investment firm, recalled that he lived in a <br>very different world from Roosevelt's. Whereas FDR ate at the Groton table <br>on the Gold Coast and went to fashionable parties in Boston, Sachs and his <br>friends lived in the Yard and ate cheap and disagreeable food at table 30 in <br>Memorial Hall, which served 21 meals a week for $4.25.16<br> Yet Roosevelt got along with his fellow students on the Crimson. <br>Though hardly a crusading president (he devoted his editorial energies to <br>such issues as the deficiencies of the football team and the need for wider <br>walkways in the Yard), he revealed a talent as a leader. Recalling that <br>Roosevelt "liked people . . . and made them instinctively like him," his <br>classmate and successor as Crimson president, Walter Russell Bowie, <br>observed that "in his geniality was a kind of frictionless command."17<br> Though the Crimson presidency was a prestigious position, the <br>pinnacle of social success at Harvard resided in membership in the <br>Porcellian, the oldest and most exclusive of the "final clubs." On the face of <br>it, Roosevelt seemed a perfect candidate &#x2014; his father had been named an <br>honorary member of Porcellian, and Cousin Theodore had also belonged. <br>Roosevelt had also attended the right boarding school; of the sixteen juniors <br>and seniors in Porcellian, five were Groton alumni.18<br> The Porcellian stood at the summit of Harvard's elaborate and <br>rigid social hierarchy, which began to sort students from the moment the new <br>freshmen arrived in Cambridge. By sophomore year, the class was officially <br>divided into the social elect and the outsiders by the venerable Institute of <br>1770, which identified the one hundred members of the class most fit <br>for "society." Elections were organized into groups of ten, with the first group <br>chosen by the previous class, the "first ten" choosing the second, and so on <br>until the tenth and final group had been selected. So exalted was election to <br>the Institute that the Boston newspapers and the Crimson published the <br>names of the students in the precise order in which they were admitted, a <br>practice that continued through 1904.19<br> Roosevelt, however, was bypassed not only by the "first ten" but <br>also by the four groups that followed. In late November, his roommate Lathrop <br>Brown was chosen, and Roosevelt was in a state of intense anxiety. Finally, <br>on January 9, 1902, he received word that he had been picked as "the first <br>man among the 6th ten."20 His election, albeit late, would give him automatic <br>entrance to Delta Kappa Epsilon (also known as DKE or "the Dickey"), a <br>secret fraternity that required its members to undergo arduous initiation rites <br>that have been aptly described ...</p><h2>When Computers Were Human</h2><p><p>Before Palm Pilots and iPods, PCs and laptops, the term "computer" referred to the people who did scientific calculations by hand. These workers were neither calculating geniuses nor idiot savants but knowledgeable people who, in other circumstances, might have become scientists in their own right. <i>When Computers Were Human</i> represents the first in-depth account of this little-known, 200-year epoch in the history of science and technology.</p><br><p> Beginning with the story of his own grandmother, who was trained as a human computer, David Alan Grier provides a poignant introduction to the wider world of women and men who did the hard computational labor of science. His grandmother's casual remark, "I wish I'd used my calculus," hinted at a career deferred and an education forgotten, a secret life unappreciated; like many highly educated women of her generation, she studied to become a human computer because nothing else would offer her a place in the scientific world.</p><br><p> The book begins with the return of Halley's comet in 1758 and the effort of three French astronomers to compute its orbit. It ends four cycles later, with a UNIVAC electronic computer projecting the 1986 orbit. In between, Grier tells us about the surveyors of the French Revolution, describes the calculating machines of Charles Babbage, and guides the reader through the Great Depression to marvel at the giant computing room of the Works Progress Administration.</p><br><br><p> <i>When Computers Were Human</i> is the sad but lyrical story of workers who gladly did the hard labor of research calculation in the hope that they might be part of the scientific community. In the end, they were rewarded by a new electronic machine that took the place and the name of those who were, once, the computers.</p></p><p><p>"<i>When Computers Were Human</i> is a detailed and fascinating look at a world I had not even known existed. After reading these accounts of ingenuity, determination, and true creative breakthrough, readers will look at today's computer-based society in an entirely different way."--<b>James Fallows, National Correspondent, <i>Atlantic Monthly</i></b></p><p>"How did the lives of people and the lives of numbers become so intimately entwined? David Alan Grier's authoritative, engaging, and richly detailed account of this neglected chapter in the history (and prehistory) of computing abounds with remarkable characters, sheds long-awaited light on their achievements, and could not have been better told."--<b>George Dyson, author of <i>Darwin among the Machines</i></b></p><p>"The story of computation before the invention of the computer is an important one--one that has not been told in this way before. This narrative grabs you right from the first page. Grier tells the human story behind some of the greatest scientific accomplishments, and tells it in a very readable way."--<b>Michael R. Williams, Head Curator, Computer History Museum</b></p><p>"The history of the electronic computer has become the topic of a fair amount of scholarly work, and yet the wonderful story of the (collective) human computer has barely been noticed. This book will appeal both to an appreciable range of scholars and to more general readers. The style is pleasant and informal; the mathematics, accessible and interesting."--<b>Theodore M.

Why do you not just kill the despot who oppresses the people and has put a price on your head? This I have been asked several times. "Because I am not an enemy of the tyrant," I reply, "because if I killed the man, tyranny would still persist, and it is this that I fight against; because if I were to launch myself blindly against him, I would do what the dog does when biting the stone, unconsciously injuring itself, without discerning or understanding the impulse from where the injury comes." Tyranny is the logical result of a social illness, which has as its present remedy the Revolution, given that peaceful resistance according to the Tolstoyan doctrine would only produce at this time the annihilation of the few who understand its simplicity and practice it. Inviolable laws of nature govern beings and things: the cause is the creation of the effect; the environment determines in an absolute way the appearance and qualities of the product; where there are putrefying materials, worms live; wherever an organism arises and develops, this is due to the existence of elements for its appearance and nutrition. The bloodiest and most ferocious tyrannies and despotisms cannot transgress this law, which has no trap doors. These oppressive systems exist; beyond the perimeter prevails a special state of the environment, of which they are the result. If they cause offense, damages, or disturbances, one must seek their annulment through the transformation of this morbid environment, not just through the simple assassination of the tyrant. In order to destroy tyranny, the isolated death of one man is ineffective, whether he be tsar, sultan, dictator, or president. Such assassination would be equivalent to procuring the dessication of a swamp by killing the vermin every so often born in it.<br>If it were otherwise, nothing would be more practical or simple than to go after the individual and tear him to shreds. Modern science gives us powerful instruments that have assured and terrible effectiveness, ones which, upon being used once and creating an insignificant number of victims, would realize the freedom of the people. Then the Revolution would have no excuse or goal. For a majority of people, revolution and war have the same meaning: this is an error that in light of presumptuous criteria makes the supreme resource of the oppressed appear to be barbarism. War has the invariable characteristics of hatred and national or personal ambitions; from it comes a relative benefit for a given individual or group who is paid with the blood and sacrifice of the masses. The Revolution is an abrupt shaking off, part of the human tendency toward improvement, when a more or less numerous proportion of humanity is subordinated by violence to a state that is incompatible with its necessities and aspirations. Against humanity are wars waged, but never revolutions; the former destroy, perpetuating injustices, while the latter mix, agitate, confuse, disrupt, and melt in the purifying fire of new ideas the old elements poisoned by prejudice and eaten away by moths, to extract from the ardent crucible of catastrophe a more benign environment for the development and expansion of all species. The Revolution is the torrent that overflows the dryness of the dead countryside, so as to extend the mud of life which transforms the wastelands of the forced peace, where only reptiles reside, into fertile lands conditioned for the splendid flowering of superior species.<br>Tyrants do not emerge from the people by a self-generating phenomenon. The universal law of determinism raises them onto the backs of the people. The same law, manifesting itself in the powerful revolutionary transformation, will make them fall forever, asphyxiated like the fish that is deprived of its liquid abode.<br>The Revolution is a fully conscious act, not the spasm of a primitive bestiality. There is no inconsistency between the idea that guides and the action that is imposed.</p><h2>A History of Russia, Central Asia and Mongolia, Volume II: Inner Eurasia from the Mongol Empire to Today, 1260 - 2000 (Blackwell History of the World)</h2><p><p><b>Provides an all-encompassing look at the history of Russia, Central Asia, and Mongolia</b></p> <p>Beginning with the breakup of the Mongol Empire in the mid-thirteenth century, Volume II of this comprehensive work covers the remarkable history of &#x201c;Inner Eurasia,&#x201d; from 1260 up to modern times, completing the story begun in Volume I.

This volume represents the first time those lectures have been published.</p><br><p> Lord Robbins (1898-1984) was a remarkably accomplished thinker, writer, and public figure. He made important contributions to economic theory, methodology, and policy analysis, directed the economic section of Winston Churchill's War Cabinet, and served as chairman of the <i>Financial Times</i>. As a historian of economic ideas, he ranks with Joseph Schumpeter and Jacob Viner as one of the foremost scholars of the century. These lectures, delivered at the London School of Economics between 1979 and 1981 and tape-recorded by Robbins's grandson, display his mastery of the intellectual history of economics, his infectious enthusiasm for the subject, and his eloquence and incisive wit. They cover a broad chronological range, beginning with Plato, Aristotle, and Aquinas, focusing extensively on Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus and the classicals, and finishing with a discussion of moderns and marginalists from Marx to Alfred Marshall. Robbins takes a varied and inclusive approach to intellectual history. As he says in his first lecture: "I shall go my own sweet way--sometimes talk about doctrine, sometimes talk about persons, sometimes talk about periods." The lectures are united by Robbins's conviction that it is impossible to understand adequately contemporary institutions and social sciences without understanding the ideas behind their development.</p><br><p> Authoritative yet accessible, combining the immediacy of the spoken word with Robbins's exceptional talent for clear, well-organized exposition, this volume will be welcomed by anyone interested in the intellectual origins of the modern world.</p></p><p><p>"Anyone reading these lectures can, and surely will, admire their style, the range of material they cover, the dazzling intellectual brilliance, and the stimulation they provide."<b>--From the foreword by William J.

This unique anthology reflects on the aesthetic, cultural, and philosophical meaning of color through the writings of artists and critics, placed within the broader context of anthropology, film, philosophy, literature, and science. Those who loathe color have had as much to say as those who love it. This chronology of writings from Baudelaire to Baudrillard traces how artists have affirmed color as a space of pure sensation, embraced it as a tool of revolution or denounced it as decorative and even decadent. It establishes color as a central theme in the story of modern and contemporary art and provides a fascinating handbook to the definitions and debates around its history, meaning, and use.</p><p><b>Artists surveyed include:</b><br>Joseph Albers, Mel Bochner, Daniel Buren, Carlos Cruz-Diez, Robert Delaunay, Sonia Delaunay, Jimmie Durham, Helen Frankenthaler, Paul Gauguin, Donald Judd, Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Yves Klein, Kazimir Malevich, Piero Manzoni, Henri Matisse, Henri Michaux, Beatriz Milhazes, Piet Mondrian, Barnett Newman, Kenneth Noland, H�lio Oiticica, Paul Signac, Ad Reinhardt, Gerhard Richter, Aleksandr Rodchenko, Bridget Riley, Mark Rothko, Yinka Shonibare, Jessica Stockholder, Theo van Doesburg, Vincent van Gogh, Victor Vasarely, Rachel Whiteread</p><p><b>Writers include:<br></b>Theodor Adorno, Roland Barthes, Charles Baudelaire, Jean Baudrillard, Walter Benjamin, Charles Blanc, Jacques Derrida, Thierry de Duve, Umberto Eco, Victoria Finlay, Joris-Karl Huysmans, Johannes Itten, Julia Kristeva, Claude L�vi-Strauss, Jacqueline Lichtenstein, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, John Ruskin, Adrian Stokes, Ludwig Wittgenstein</p></p><p>David Batchelor is an artist and writer who has exhibited widely in Europe and America.

This dark thriller inspired the classic film The Spiral Staircase.</p><p>Ethel Lina White was born in the spring of 1876 in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire, Wales. She grew up with five sisters and five brothers. It was much to delight her lively imagination. She wrote three novels before her first mystery, the genre that she excelled in. Indeed, Some Must Watch was made in to the movie, the Spiral Staircase three times. Two of her other books were made in to thrillers. Alfred Hitchcock used &#34;the Wheel Spins&#34; for his movie &#34;the Lady Vanishes&#34; and John Houseman used her&#34; They see in Darkness&#34; for his movie, &#34;the Unseen&#34;.

But the lifestyles and beliefs of the generation that has followed--and the influence these younger Americans in their twenties and thirties are having on the face of religion--are not so well understood. It is this next wave of post-boomers that Robert Wuthnow examines in this illuminating book.</p><br><p> What are their churchgoing habits and spiritual interests and needs? How does their faith affect their families, their communities, and their politics? Interpreting new evidence from scores of in-depth interviews and surveys, Wuthnow reveals a generation of younger adults who, unlike the baby boomers that preceded them, are taking their time establishing themselves in careers, getting married, starting families of their own, and settling down--resulting in an estimated six million fewer regular churchgoers. He shows how the recent growth in evangelicalism is tapering off, and traces how biblical literalism, while still popular, is becoming less dogmatic and more preoccupied with practical guidance. At the same time, Wuthnow explains how conflicts between religious liberals and conservatives continue--including among new immigrant groups such as Hispanics and Asians--and how in the absence of institutional support many post-boomers have taken a more individualistic, improvised approach to spirituality. Wuthnow's fascinating analysis also explores the impacts of the Internet and so-called virtual churches, and the appeal of megachurches.</p><br><br><p> <i>After the Baby Boomers</i> offers us a tantalizing look at the future of American religion for decades to come.</p></p><p><p>"Every generation is different, and in the post-boomers we have one that is as different as it gets.

Ingeniously structured and vividly related by a Tristram Shandy-esque narrator, Maria Wirtemberska's psychologically complex work is often considered Poland's first modern novel.This splendid translation by Ursula Phillips should restore Wirtemberska to her rightful place in the literary pantheon while providing fertile new ground for the study of the international development of the novel. The romantic story of the young widow Malvina and her mysterious lover Ludomir, Malvina combines several literary styles and influences&#x2015;from the epistolary to the Gothic. Nobel laureate Czeslaw Milosz argues that Malvina is quintessentially a sentimental novel&#x2015;a model of the genre whose chief aspiration is to promote a change in sensibility and inspire new forces of feeling and imagination. For this reason Wirtemberska may be compared to her English contemporary, Jane Austen.

Studying photographic practice as it is embedded in Indian society over the last 100 years, Pinney, an anthropologist, traces the various purposes and goals of photography through colonial and postcolonial times. Pinney identifies three key moments In Indian portraiture: the use of photography as a quantifiable instrument of measurement under British rule, the role of portraiture in moral instruction, and the current visual style of popular culture and its effects on modes of picturing. Photographic culture thus becomes a mutable realm in which capturing likeness is only part of the project. Today, Indian images are characterized by a distinctive postcolonial photographic practice, which involves sophisticated inventiveness and techniques such as overpainting, collage, composite printing and doubling. Contemporary portraits that showcase these techniques rely as well on elaborate backdrops and props such as motorbikes to construct an endless variety of identities, challenging the prior use of photography as documentation and description. Pinney&#39;s account of these changes in portraiture from depiction to invention is accompanied by 127 photographs, and his sensitive analysis uncovers the links between these intriguing images and the society from which they emerge.<strong>Christopher Pinney</strong> is professor of anthropology and visual culture at University College London.

Increasingly effective psychopharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments have facilitated matriculation for students with histories of anxiety, mood, personality, eating and substance abuse disorders. This phenomenon has been accompanied by a striking increase in the number of previously undiagnosed students requesting treatment. College and university mental health programs struggle to care for larger numbers of students, necessitating greater interdisciplinary collaboration in treatment, research, outreach, and educational services. <p>This book fills an important gap in the literature and provides a comprehensive resource for nearly every aspect of college mental health. It includes a strong emphasis on the training and education of graduate and professional students for future work in this field. Chapters are devoted to the significant ethical and legal issues related to treatment and associated administrative and policy challenges. Scholarly chapters on the promise of community mental health and public health approaches are especially innovative. There is also a chapter on international issues in college mental health which will be helpful to those students studying abroad. <i>Mental Health Care in the College Community</i> is written by acknowledged experts from mental health, college and university administration, legal and educational disciplines, all with extensive administrative and clinical experience in higher education settings. This book is clearly written and well illustrated with abundant tables, charts, and figures.</p> <p>This text will become essential reading for college mental health clinicians, graduate students in the mental health disciplines (psychiatry, psychology, counselling, nursing, and social work), student affairs deans and their staff, and even presidents or provosts of universities and colleges.</p></p><p><b>Dr. Kay</b> is a Fellow of the American College of Psychiatrists and Distinguished Life Fellow of the American Psychiatric Association and has served as the chair of the APA Committee on Medical Student Education, the Council on Medical Education and Career Development, the Vestermark Award Board, and the Committee on the Practice of Psychotherapy.

His best-known book, The Story of Art - first published 50 years ago and now in its 16th edition - is one of the most influential books ever written about art. His books further include Art and Illusion(1979) and The Preference for the Primitive (2002), as well as a total of 11 volumes of collected essays and reviews. Gombrich was born in Vienna in 1909 and died in London in November 2001.

The complexity and the randomness aspect of a set of natural numbers are closely related. Traditionally, computability theory is concerned with the complexity aspect. However, computability theoretic tools can also be used to introduce mathematical counterparts for the intuitive notion of randomness of a set. Recent research shows that, conversely, concepts and methods originating from randomness enrich computability theory.<br><br>Covering the basics as well as recent research results, this book provides a very readable introduction to the exciting interface of computability and randomness for graduates and researchers in computability theory, theoretical computer science, and measure theory.<br></p><p><br>Andr� Nies received his PhD in Mathematics form the University of Heidelberg, Germany, in 1992.

Facing them, from the Pas de Calais to Brittany, were German troops, dug in, waiting and preparing for the inevitable confrontation. This unique compilation of in-depth accounts by German commanders presents D-Day, and the events leading up to it, from the point of view of the officers entrusted with preventing the Allied landings. The accounts David Isby has selected, all written soon after the war&#39;s close for American military intelligence, cover preparations for invasion and intricately chart the development of German strategy as invasion looms. After detailing this planning stage, and the uncertain waiting, the accounts then turn to the ordeal of D-Day itself, the reactions to the first reports of troop landings, and a blow-by-blow account of the fighting. Fighting the Invasion paints a superb picture of D-Day from the German perspective, bringing home the entire experience from the initial waiting to the bitter fighting on the beaches and running battles in Norman villages. These are first-hand accounts by German officers and commanders that have never been published before in any language.</p><p>David C. Isby is the editor of Fighting the Bombers (1853675326) and Fighting in Normandy (1853674605).This book is actually a collection of documents written by captured German officers (most of whom were General officers)at the end of WWII, mostly in 1946 and 1947. The majority of these documents were produced by the US Army Historical Section and have never been published in full before. While most historians writing on the war in Western Europe have used them as major sources, general access to them is quite difficult. I have managed to obtain copies of some by interlibrary loan, but many are unavailable. Almost every author complains of the fact that they were being compelled to write these reports by their American captors under "appalling conditions" and without access to their war diaries, other documents and fellow soldiers. Conditions notwithstanding, they were forced to write almost completely from memory so many of the details of most if not all of the reports are questionable. --A Customer<br><br>This volume seeks to show, from the viewpoint of the German Army, one of the most decisive events of the Second World War: the Allied invasion of Normandy on D-Day, 6 June, 1944 and the events leading up to it and those flowing from it. It consists of parts of the military studies written for the US Army by senior (lt. colonel and above) German Army officers post-war and have been used as source material in all subsequent writing on Normandy. They represent, together; the most detailed German account of the fighting. As has often been pointed out, these documents all have to be used with caution. The earlier ones were done when the authors were prisoners of war, the later ones when they were paid employees of the US Army. Most of them - especially the earlier reports -- were done largely without reference to war diaries, war maps or official papers. While written by participants - many of whom never wrote their memoirs or other accounts in any language - while their memories were still fresh, their immediacy is not matched by attention to detail - dates and places are sometimes wrong or inconsistent - or their impartiality. In some cases, the threat of prosecution for war crimes obviously influenced the writing. Some ended up doing hard time or the high jump. Blumentritt's admiration of his boss, Field Marshal von Rundstedt, was doubtlessly genuine. But it comes across as "my boss was a wonderful old gentlemen, a natural aristocrat, and ignorant of any atrocities. I can say this because I burned all the incriminating evidence myself". The authors also do not spend much ink on introspection and self-revelation, but self-justification and pointing the finger at others is always in order when former generals are let near a typewriter, as the recent round of Gulf War memoirs show. A Rashomon-like quality pervades, with the same events being described by multiple writers while - even more frustrating - more significant events are ignored. The quality of the writing and the translation varies greatly. This book certainly does not tell the complete German side of D-Day. But the documents included in this volume remain a valid part of that picture. --y Anne<br><br>This is a great book. A compilation of memoirs and first hand accounts from German Soldiers who were there. It doesn't get any better than that. In the second half of the book maps are widely used and incredibly helpful. However in the beginning of the book there are no maps. This portion of the book was dealing with where the German commanders believed the invasion would come. It would have been very helpful to have a map showing where each officer believed the invasion would come and where it actually did. I am interested to know how close their estimates were. Not to mention that some of these little French villages are a bit obscure, and a map would be helpful. Don't get me wrong the second half of the book has a lot of maps and is a pleasure to read. A very good addition to any library concerning tactical defense of the Normandy Coast in WW II. --erin mcatee</p><h2>Elementary Linear Algebra with Applications</h2><p>Book by Rorres, Chris, Anton, Howard</p><p></p><h2>My Book Full of Feelings: How to Control and React to the Size of Your Emotions</h2><p>Based on the newest research on the predictive brain and ASD, this highly engaging workbook is an ideal way to help teach children with autism spectrum disorder to identify, assess the intensity of, and respond appropriately to their emotions.

Yet to this day the scientific establishment has steadfastly refused to engage in systematic study of what they are. This book examines why. <p>Randles and Warrington establish by detailed case histories of many UFO sightings that unexplained phenomena certainly exist. Picking their way expertly through the maze of misinformation and fantasy, they examine the possible explanations, rejecting the 'standard' view- that UFO's are alien spaceships- in favour of more scientifically based and testable ideas. They suggest ways in which scientific standard should be applied and consider the fruits that such enquiries might yield- and the potential consequences for mankind of explaining the hitherto inexplicable.</p></p><p><b>Jenny Randles</b> is National Director of Investigations at the British UFO Research Association. Peter Warrington is a Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society and Editor of the <i>Manchester Astronomical Society Journal of Record</i>.Two British ufologists provide a historical overview of UFO research and discuss the scientific community's growing interest in seriously studying the phenomenon. The authors characterize ufology's past research methods as generally unscientific and its findings as sensationalistic. Citing the need for a more professional approach they include a ``Code of Practice for UFO Investigators'' and recommend the founding of an interdisciplinary scientific institute to study recent sightings. Many of the British UFO cases will be new to American buffs and the annotated bibliography will be useful to those wanting to select the best available literature for further study.

Collectors of her works are awed by her innovative use of traditional aboriginal symbols, which transcend the specific culture from which they come. </p><p> In the early 1960s, her development of a recognizable "Odjig style" garnered her enough attention to make possible her first solo show in 1967. Odjig's reputation as an artist was growing internationally and her commissioned painting Earth Mother was displayed at EXPO '70 in Japan. Odjig's importance as a Canadian artist is immeasurable. Bob Boyer, a renowned Metis artist and lecturer, absorbingly explores in his preface the place of Native art in the broader spectrum of Canadian culture, in order to provide a more in-depth perspective on Odjig's significance. Pamela Krueger, an award-winning appreciator of Canadian art, discusses in the introduction the course of Odjig's life and career and places her art into its cultural context. </p></p><p><p> <b>Daphne Odjig</b> was born in 1919 on the Wikwemikong Reserve, Manitoulin Island, Ontario.

Although researchers knew that DES caused cancer and disrupted sexual development, doctors prescribed it for millions of women, initially for menopause and then for miscarriage, while farmers gave cattle the hormone to promote rapid weight gain. Its residues, and those of other chemicals, in the American food supply are changing the internal ecosystems of human, livestock, and wildlife bodies in increasingly troubling ways. </p><p>In this gripping exploration, Nancy Langston shows how these chemicals have penetrated into every aspect of our bodies and ecosystems, yet the U.S. government has largely failed to regulate them and has skillfully manipulated scientific uncertainty to delay regulation.

Bowen&#39;s association with higher education spanned six decades -- from 1925 when he set off for college, to his retirement in 1985, capping a brilliant academic career. In that time he rose from undergraduate and graduate student to professor of economics, college dean, and finally, university president and chancellor. Here he reminisces about his experiences at the six institutions with which he was intimately associated: Washington State University, the University of Iowa, the University of Illinois, Williams College, Grinnell College, and Claremont University Center and Graduate School. These candid memoirs not only recall his life and that of his family, but they provide a vivid, first-person account of the remarkable evolution of American higher education during the turbulent modern era. As Dr. Bowen writes: &#34;During much of the sixty years, these institutions, and indeed all of higher education, were going through rapid growth and development. They were also adjusting to momentous social changes relating, for example, to war and peace, economic depression and prosperity, advancing knowledge and technology, changing demography, new mores and values, and new classes of students. I was an interested witness and active participant in the many adjustments required by these social changes.&#34; These warm recollections bear striking testimony to the resilient nature and indomitable spirit of one of this country&#39;s most precious resource - it&#39;s colleges and universities.</p><p></p><h2>James II (The English Monarchs Series)</h2><p>James II (1633&#x2013;1701) lacked the charisma of his father, Charles I, but shared his tendency to dismiss the views of others when they differed from his own. Failing to understand his subjects, James was also misunderstood by them. In this highly-regarded biography, John Miller reassesses James II and his reign, drawing on a wide array of primary sources from France, Italy, and Ireland as well as England. Miller argues that the king had many laudable attributes--he was brave, loyal, honorable, and hard-working, and he was at least as benevolent toward his people as his father had been. Yet James&#x2019;s conversion to Catholicism fueled the distrust of his Protestant subjects who placed the worst possible construction on his actions and statements. Although James came to see the securing of religious freedom for Catholics in the wider context of freedom for all religious minorities, his people naturally doubted the sincerity of his commitment to toleration.<br><br>The book explores James&#x2019;s relations with the state and society, focusing on the political, diplomatic, and religious issues that shaped his reign. Miller discusses the human failings, the gulf of understanding between the king and his subjects, and the sheer bad luck that led to James&#x2019;s downfall. He also considers the reasons for James&#x2019;s lack of interest in recovering his kingdom after his flight to France in 1688. This revised edition of the book includes a substantial new foreword assessing recent work on the reign.<br><br>&#x201c;This is a first-class essay in historical biography. . . .

But such stories filled medical journals as well as fiction, and fear in the populace was high. It was speculated, from the number of skeletons found in horrific, contorted positions inside their coffins, that ten out of every one hundred people were buried before they were dead. With over fifty illustrations, <em>Buried Alive</em> explores the medicine, folklore, history, and literature of Europe and the United States to uncover why such fears arose and whether they were warranted. "A weird and wonderful little tome."&#x2015;Salon.com "Bondeson weaves a strange disturbing, and weirdly enthralling tale. Cremation never sounded so good."&#x2015;<em>Lingua Franca</em> "A most useful and entertaining book....Deserves a place on every bedside table in America."&#x2015;Patrick McGrath, author of <em>Martha Peake: A Novel of the Revolution</em>&nbsp; More than 50 illustrations</p><p>What could be worse than waking up in a dark, confined space and realizing that you are in a sealed coffin? Jan Bondeson details the history--factual and fictional--of this primal fear in <i>Buried Alive</i>.<p> Premature burial has a long literary history, from Boccaccio's <i>Decameron</i> to <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> to Wilkie Collins's <i>Jezebel's Daughter</i> and, of course, Edgar Allan Poe's "Premature Burial" and other works. Macabre tales of narrow escapes owing to grave robbers and lazy gravediggers, as well as horrific stories of exhumed coffins containing bloodied, contorted corpses, were common in both the medical and the lay press in the 18th and 19th centuries. Bondeson shows how these stories reflected public fears--fears caused in part by the development of resuscitation techniques for drowning victims, which fed a growing doubt in the reliability of prevailing signs of death. The medical community was divided on the issue; some were offended that the general public doubted their ability to determine death. Others, however, searched for definitive signs of death, many of which seem ludicrous today (one suggestion involved sticking the finger of a suspected corpse in the doctor's ear; if life remained the doctor would hear a faint buzzing sound). Bondeson also describes, in gleeful detail, other systems developed to prevent premature burial, including elaborate security coffins with signaling devices inside. More remarkable are the "Leichenh�user" or waiting mortuaries where corpses were kept in warm rooms until putrefaction was evident. Each corpse had a number of strings or wires attached to its fingers and toes, so that the slightest twitch would sound an alarm and medical aid could be brought immediately. These Leichenh�user were built in many cities in German-speaking Europe; one built in Munich in 1808 featured both a common and a luxury section and was open to the public (Mark Twain visited in the 1880s); the Vienna Leichenh�us used an electronic warning system (though not in its separate section for suicides, it's interesting to note); and two were built in Stuttgart as late as 1875.</p><p> Were these precautions necessary? No "patient" ever actually revived while in any of the German waiting mortuaries, but Bondeson does describe some documented near-miss cases from the 20th century in which supposed corpses were revived. Throughout the book, Bondeson recounts old wives' tales, urban legends, and scientific study with equal levels of straightforwardness and humor--and, perhaps, a slight smirk. Though it's not for the squeamish (which is perhaps an unnecessary warning; what squeamish person is going to read a book about premature burial?), <i>Buried Alive</i> is an entertaining and eminently readable look at this little-known history. <i>--Sunny Delaney</i></p>Jan Bondeson, a physician, holds a Ph.D. in experimental medicine and works at the Kennedy Institute of Rheumatology in London.</p><h2>Ethnic Groups Worldwide: A Ready Reference Handbook</h2><p><p>The arrangement of information and ease of use make this comprehensive handbook unlike any other reference source currently available on ethnic groups. Organized alphabetically by country name within four major regions, the book features a series of succinct profiles that describe the ethnic composition and ethnic relations of each country of the world. These profiles offer a quick snapshot of each ethnic.</p></p><p><p>DAVID LEVINSON, Ph.D., is a cultural anthropologist and partner in Berkshire Reference Works. Previously, he was vice president for the Human Relations Area Files at Yale University. Levinson was editor-in-chief for the 10 volume Encyclopedia of World Cultures, senior editor (with Melvin Ember) of the Encyclopedia of Cultural Anthropology, author of Ethnic Relations, and coauthor (with Karen Christensen) of Global Village Companion.</p>In an increasingly multicultural world where ethnic relations and conflict affect many people both directly and indirectly, interest in ethnic groups may well be at an all-time high. This handbook collects background and current information on ethnic groups and provides helpful analysis for users who would otherwise have to research a variety of sources to gather the same information. Author Levinson is well known in the ethnic studies area and has edited and contributed to a number of other books, including the 10-volume <i>Encyclopedia of World Cultures</i> (G. K. Hall, 1991^-96) and <i>American Immigrant Cultures: Builders of a Nation</i> (Macmillan, 1997). Levinson's description of how he chose which ethnic groups to include explains that, while neatly delineating ethnic groups is problematic, some of the criteria considered were language, religion, common history, occupational specialization, regional localization, common culture, and self-identification. When ethnic groups are known by several names, the one most common at the present time is used, with references to alternative names.<p>Information is divided into four sections--Europe, Africa, Asia and the Pacific, and the Americas--with each section containing description and analysis of ethnicity in each nation in that region. Each regional section begins with an introduction, bibliography of sources, and maps. The nation profiles include three categories of information. First, there is an overview of the major ethnic groups or clusters of related ethnic groups in the late 1990s. Included are indigenous groups and nonindigenous or immigrant groups. Second, there are brief descriptions of these ethnic groups, including location, population, religion, and basic economic, social, and political practices. Third, a brief analysis is given of the current state of ethnic relations in that nation. The book's introduction adds significant value by discussing topics such as ethnocentrism, stereotyping, ethnic politics, indigenous rights movements, immigration, and assimilation. The index is very detailed, allowing the user to locate, as examples, information on Croats in Sweden or Evangelical Christians in Kuwait.</p><p>Both<i> Encyclopedia of World Cultures </i>and the four-volume <i>Worldmark Encyclopedia of Cultures and Daily Life </i>[RBB My 1 98] are organized by culture group within broad geographic regions. The country-by-country approach adopted for his new title allows Levinson to provide a different perspective, highlighting relations among the various ethnic groups that share national boundaries. Although necessarily less detailed, the book's arrangement and convenient format nicely complement the multivolume sets. High-school, academic, and public libraries will find this to be a valuable resource for orientation to and education about ethnic groups and ethnicity. <i></i></p></p><h2>Negotiation Games (Routledge Advances in Game Theory)</h2><p>Steven J.

Harry Lime&#39;s return from the dead in &#39;The Third Man&#39; (1949), Carol Reed&#39;s unique thriller set in occupied Vienna, is one of the most famous scenes in all cinema. But there is more besides: the zither score, the tilted shots, the cuckoo-clock speech, the desperate manhunt in the city sewers. A British-American co-production overseen by Alexander Korda and David O. Selznick, &#39;The Third Man&#39; was written by Graham Greene, photographed by Robert Krasker and featured, along with Welles, Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli and Trevor Howard. All of the did superb work under Reed&#39;s subtle direction. After &#39;The Third Man&#39;, Carol Reed was hailed as one of the world&#39;s great directors. This title sets out to understand what kind of artist Reed was and whether he deserved such accolades.

Combining a strong applied flavor with straightforward and lively writing, <i>The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator</i> presents a unified, and comprehensive overview of the insights, strategies, and practices inherent to successful negotiations and addresses the most common myths and pitfalls that plague negotiators. This unique book weaves together a wide range of disciplines in its study of negotiation and discusses distributive negotiation, win-win negotiation, developing a negotiating style, creativity and problem solving, and cross-cultural negotiation. For those in psychology, sociology, and organizational behavior economics interested in improving their negotiation skills.</p><p><p> <b><i>Leigh L. Thompson</i></b> is the J. L. and Helen Kellogg Distinguished Professor of Management and Organizations in the Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. She is the director of the AT&amp;T Behavioral Research Laboratory at Kellogg, an executive member of the Dispute Resolution Research Center, and also conducts the Negotiation Strategies and Leading High Impact Teams Executive Programs at Kellogg. An active consultant and trainer, Thompson has taught negotiation skills to executives and managers all over the world. </p> <p> An internationally recognized scholar, Thompson has published 3 books and over 50 articles in leading management journals and books. Thompson has received numerous awards and honors for her research, including the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, a fellowship at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, California, and a grant from Citigroup Behavioral Sciences Research Council of Citibank. </p><p> This book is dedicated to negotiators who want to improve their ability to negotiate&#x2014;whether that be multimillion-dollar business deals or personal interactions. Many books address the issues of negotiation, so why this one? If I were to cite a single reason why I wrote a book in this saturated field it is this: <i>The science of negotiation can help people dramatically improve their ability to negotiate economically better deals and also psychologically better deals.</i> Simply stated: You can improve your monetary returns and feel better about yourself and the people you deal with. This book contains an integration of theory, scientific research, and practical examples. Moreover, the practical examples&#x2014;selected from hundreds of real-world negotiations involving people from several companies&#x2014;illustrate effective as well as ineffective negotiation skills. </p> <p> Here is what you can expect when you read this book: </p> <ul> <li><b>Illustrative case studies and real-life negotiations:</b> I have included several examples and actual cases of negotiating in managerial and executive contexts. Each chapter opens with a case analysis (often from the business world, but government, community, and personal life as well). Furthermore, many of the points in the chapters are supplemented with illustrations and examples drawn from actual negotiations, both contemporary and historical. I do not use these examples to prove a theory; rather, I use them to <i>illustrate</i> how many of the concepts in the book are borne out in real-world situations.</li> <li><b>Skills-based approach:</b> I provide practical take-away points for the manager and the executive. A good example is Chapter 4 on integrative negotiation. A series of hands-on principles that have been proven to increase the value of negotiated deals are provided. Moreover, several students and clients have written, indicating how they utilized the tools in their actual business negotiations. Those examples are included as well.</li> <li><b>Self-insight:</b> We included several ways that negotiators can test their own intuition and approach. For example, Chapter 5, Developing a Negotiating Style, allows negotiators to assess their "instinctive" bargaining style and provides suggestions for how to further develop their bargaining repertoire. Moreover, Chapter 10 provides a deep look at cultural differences in negotiation so that the negotiator can better understand his or her own cultural style and that of others.</li> <li><b>Sophisticated bargaining skills:</b> The second and third sections of the book deal with complex, yet commonly occurring negotiating situations, such as negotiating with agents, mediation and arbitration, negotiating via e-mail and conference call, negotiating with competitor companies, and of course, negotiating cross-culturally.</li> </ul> <p> I took the task of revising <i>The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator</i> very seriously. Every chapter has a new opening section that illustrates a real-world negotiation and no fewer than 135 examples from the business world have been added since the last edition. Also, I cited the ground-breaking results of more than 200 new scientific articles on negotiation. benefit greatly from the advice, comments, and critiques given to me by my students and colleagues, and I hope that their advice keeps coming so that I am able to improve upon the book even further. </p> <p> The research and ideas in this book come from an invaluable set of scholars in the fields of social psychology, organizational behavior, sociology, negotiation, and cognitive psychology. My research, thinking, and writing has been inspired in important ways by the following people: Wendi Adair, Cameron Anderson, Linda Babcock, Max Bazerman,Kristin Behfar, Terry Boles, Jeanne Brett, Susan Brodt, Karen Cates, Hoon-Seok Choi, Gary Fine, Craig Fox, Adam Galinsky, Wendi Gardner, Dedre Gentner, Robert Gibbons, Kevin Gibson, James Gillespie, Rich Gonzalez, Deborah Gruenfeld, Reid Hastie, Andy Hoffman, Peter Kim, Shirli Kopelman, Rod Kramer, Laura Kray, Terri Kurtzburg, Geoffrey Leonardelli, John Levine, Allan Lind, George Loewenstein, Jeff Loewenstein, Deepak Malhotra, Beta Mannix, Kathleen McGinn, Vicki Medvec, Tanya Menon, Dave Messick, Terry Mitchell, Don Moore, Michael Morris, Keith Murnighan, Janice Nadler, Maggie Neale, Kathy Phillips, Robin Pinkley, Ashleigh Rosette, Nancy Rothbard, Elizabeth Seerey, Marwan Sinaceur, Harris Sondak, Tom Tyler, Leaf Van Boven, Kimberly Wade-Benzoni, Laurie Weingart, and Judith White. <i>In The Mind and Heart of the Negotiator,</i> I use the pronoun "we" because so much of my thinking has been influenced and shaped by this set of eminent scholars. </p> <p> The revision of this book would not have been possible without the dedication, organization, and editorial skills of Sean McMillan, who created the layout, organized hundreds of drafts, mastered the figures, and researched many case studies for this book. </p> <p> In this book, I talk about the "power of the situation" and how strongly the environment shapes our behavior. The Kellogg School of Management is one of the most supportive, dynamic environments I have ever had the pleasure to be a part of. In particular, Dean Dipak Jain and Associate Deans Robert Magee and Robert Korajczyk have strongly supported research as well as teaching, and intellectual leadership as well as pedagogical leadership. I am particularly indebted to my wonderful visionary colleague, Jeanne Brett, who created the Dispute Resolution Research Center (DRRC) at Kellogg in 1986, and to the Hewlett Foundation for their generous support of the DRRC. Grants from the National Science Foundation's Decision Risk and Management Science program have made it possible for me to conduct several of the research studies that I discuss in this book. I am also grateful for a grant received by the Citigroup Research Council, which made possible many of the studies about learning and negotiation reviewed in this book. </p> <p> This book is very much a team effort of the people I have mentioned here, whose talents are diverse, broad, and extraordinarily impressive. I am deeply indebted to my colleagues and my students, and I feel grateful that they have touched my life and this book. </p></p><h2>Japanese For Young People II: Student Book (Japanese for Young People Series)</h2><p>A new and exciting approach to basic Japanese for young adults<br><br>The Association for Japanese-Language Teaching (AJALT), renowned for its <em>Japanese for Busy People</em> series, has developed a comprehensive course for teaching Japanese to young adulsts in English-speaking countries.<br><br><em>Japanese for Young People</em> is a new three-level series designed primarily for junior-high and high school curricula encouraging systematic Japanese-language acquisition through an enjoyable but structured learning process.

Profound and humorous, companionable and curmudeonly, Walking, by America&#39;s first nature writer, is your personal and portable guide to the activity that, like no other, awakens the senses and the soul to the &#34;absolute freedom and wildness&#34; of nature.</p><p>Henry David Thoreau (1817&#x2013;1862) (properly pronounced Thaw-roe) was an American author, poet, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry total over 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions were his writings on natural history and philosophy, where he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern day environmentalism. His literary style interweaves close natural observation, personal experience, pointed rhetoric, symbolic meanings, and historical lore; while displaying a poetic sensibility, philosophical austerity, and "Yankee" love of practical detail. He was also deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay; at the same time he advocated abandoning waste and illusion in order to discover life's true essential needs. He was a lifelong abolitionist, delivering lectures that attacked the Fugitive Slave Law while praising the writings of Wendell Phillips and defending abolitionist John Brown. Thoreau's philosophy of civil disobedience influenced the political thoughts and actions of such later figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. Thoreau is sometimes cited as an individualist anarchist. Though Civil Disobedience seems to call for improving rather than abolishing government &#x2013; "I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government" &#x2013; the direction of this improvement points toward anarchism: "'That government is best which governs not at all;' and when men are prepared for it, that will be the kind of government which they will have." Richard Drinnon partly blames Thoreau for the ambiguity, noting that Thoreau's "sly satire, his liking for wide margins for his writing, and his fondness for paradox provided ammunition for widely divergent interpretations of 'Civil Disobedience.'" He further points out that although Thoreau writes that he only wants "at once" a better government, that does not rule out the possibility that a little later he might favor no government.</p><h2>Linux Programming by Example</h2><p>Linux Programming by Example: The Fundamentals<br><br></p><p>Anyone who's done programming work knows that you spend half your coding time looking for other people's solutions to the problems you're facing in your project. Particularly when you're dealing with times, dates, standard calculations, and other common problems, you find yourself saying, "Someone must have solved this before." And, indeed, someone usually has. <i>Linux Programming by Example</i> is a dense compendium of Linux software solutions--tools, algorithms, and procedures that solve data-processing challenges of the sort that crop up in all sorts of software projects. Though it does not address X11 user-interface programming or network communications much, this book does a great job of communicating recommended practices for command-line interfaces, filesystem manipulation, internationalization and localization, and inter-process communications. Taken together with <i>The Art of Unix Programming</i>, this book will help you solve difficult Linux programming problems quickly.<p> Unlike a lot of code-oriented books, this one manages to keep its samples concise, and devote more space to discussions of why things are done than to the code that actually does them. This promotes understanding: You can always mess around with the code yourself on your own. Overall, Arnold Robbins does an excellent job of stripping away some of the hacker mystique to reveal the code behind the curtain. This book shows how to work Linux magic. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Linux programming in C, mostly at a level concerned with user input from the command line, file I/O, interprocess signalling, and memory management.</p>"This is an excellent introduction to Linux programming.

I learned things myself, especially about internationalization, and I&#x2019;ve been at this for quite a while." <p>&#x2014;Chet Ramey, Coauthor and Maintainer of the Bash shell </p><p>"This is a good introduction to Linux programming. Arnold&#x2019;s technique of showing how experienced programmers use the Linux programming interfaces is a nice touch, much more useful than the canned programming examples found in most books." </p><p>&#x2014;Ulrich Drepper, Project Lead, GNU C library </p><p>"A gentle yet thorough introduction to the art of UNIX system programming, Linux Programming by Example uses code from a wide range of familiar programs to illustrate each concept it teaches. Readers will enjoy an interesting mix of in-depth API descriptions and portability guidelines, and will come away well prepared to begin reading and writing systems applications. Heartily recommended." </p><p>&#x2014;Jim Meyering, Coauthor and Maintainer of the GNU Core Utility Programs </p><p>Learn Linux� programming, hands-on... from real source code This book teaches Linux programming in the most effective way possible: by showing and explaining well-written programs. Drawing from both V7 Unix� and current GNU source code, Arnold Robbins focuses on the fundamental system call APIs at the core of any significant program, presenting examples from programs that Linux/Unix users already use every day. Gradually, one step at a time, Robbins teaches both high-level principles and "under the hood" techniques. Along the way, he carefully addresses real-world issues like performance, portability, and robustness. Coverage includes: </p><p>Memory management File I/O File metadata Processes Users and groups Sorting and searching Argument parsing Extended interfaces Signals Internationalization Debugging And more... Just learning to program? Switching from Windows�? Already developing with Linux but interested in exploring the system call interface further? No matter which, quickly and directly, this book will help you master the fundamentals needed to build serious Linux software. </p><p>Companion Web Sites, authors.phptr.</p></p><h2>Have You Considered: Evidence Beyond a Reasonable Doubt</h2><p><p><i>Have You Considered</i> is the third in a series of unique devotionals which present the evidence for creation from every area of science. &nbsp;365 different examples of how well science supports a biblical model for our origins are presented. &nbsp;Topics range from biology to geology, genetics to botany, anatomy to history, design to microbiology, Christian truths to cosmology. &nbsp;This book is marvelously illustrated with over 300 color illustrations. &nbsp;It is written in a style that is appropriate to be read to even young children yet profoundly enjoyable for adults. &nbsp;</p><p>The book also contains extensive references and includes topical, Bible verse, and subject indexes. &nbsp;It is a phenominal source for homes schoolers, Christian parents, or anyone wanting to know more about nature or creation.</p></p><p><p>Julie Von Vett has been teaching creation science and worldviews since 2003 to homeschoolers and doing seminars at churches and community events.&nbsp; Julie has beenteaching creation science to church, home school, and community groups full time since 2003. &nbsp;She literally has 500 students all over the state of Minnesota!&nbsp; Prior to this, she home educated her children, Annette and Caleb, through high school.&nbsp; After attending worldview classes at Summit Ministries in 1992, she began teaching year-long worldview classes to high school students and parents.&nbsp; She realized that the foundation of a biblical worldview begins with creation, Genesis 1-11.&nbsp; Julie has received her B.A. from St. Olaf College.&nbsp; She lives with husband Vince in Minnesota. &nbsp;In their free time they love to travel out West and explore the geology from a creationist perspective and dig dinosaurs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce has 27 years of research experience with the Dow Chemical Corporation but left in 2008 to act as full time Executive Director of <b><i>Search for the Truth Ministries</i></b> with the vision of &#x201c;<i>Awakening Hearts and Minds to Biblical Truth</i>&#x201d;.&nbsp; This organization widely distributes his Bible-affirming creation materials to students and prisoners.&nbsp; Bruce has a B.S. degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Cincinnati and holds 17 patents for new products with Dow Chemical.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce Malone has spent the last 30 years bringing the scientific evidence for creation to churches and colleges at seminars throughout the United States and 12 foreign countries. &nbsp;He has also authored six books on the evidence for creation with over 500,000 copies in print; served as adjunct speaker for the Institute for Creation Research; is an associate speaker for Logos Research Associates Inc.; and is a commissioned worldview speaker under Chuck Colson&#x2019;s Centurion program - bringing a recent Biblical creation understanding to worldview issues.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce and his wife Robin have been married for 32 years and have four grown children and four grandchildren.&nbsp; They reside in Midland, Michigan.</p></p><h2>From STEM to STEAM: Using Brain-Compatible Strategies to Integrate the Arts</h2><p><p><strong><em>Build the skills mathematicians and scientists need!</em></strong></p> <p>A is for arts&#x2015;and for the advantage students gain when you integrate arts into STEM instruction.

Schoolchildren make crude replicas of totem poles when they study northwestern tribal peoples. But in Dictionary of Native American Mythology we learn that Coyote is a cultural hero and trickster figure with vast numbers of stories from many tribes. Totem poles, while artistically beautiful, represent the animal lineage from which a human family has descended. And sand paintings are created as a part of an eight-day Navajo healing ceremony. These are just some of the more familiar of the more than 1,300 richly worded and illustrated entries. The importance of ritual and myth in creating meaning is nowhere more evident than in Native American traditions. Dictionary of Native American Mythology is a careful selection of the distinctive stories, characters, themes, symbols, and motifs that interweave the traditions of over 100 different Native American cultures. The alphabetically arranged entries are rigorously cross-referenced, allowing the reader to pursue in depth a particular path of inquiry. Each entry cites tribal origin and the corresponding geographic region. These regions in turn are keyed to ten tribal territory maps that pinpoint exact tribe locations. The massive bibliography and tribal index complete this work so that it is not only an indispensable resource for students and scholars, but also a delight to the casual browser. Dictionary of Native American Mythology is a monumental contribution to the study of Native American myth and ritual, both past and present.</p><h2>Principles of Information Technology -- Texas -- CTE/School</h2><p>Information Tech</p><p></p><h2>A Surgeon&#39;s Civil War: The Letters and Diary of Daniel M. Holt, M.D.</h2><p>Daniel M. Holt, a successful country doctor in the upstate village of Newport, New York, accepted the position of assistant surgeon in the 121st New York Volunteers in August 1862. At age 42 when he was commissioned, he was the oldest member of the staff. But his experience served him well, as his regiment participated in nearly all the major campaigns in the eastern theater of the war - Crampton's Gap before Antietam, Fredericksburg, Salem Church, the Mine Run campaign, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, Cold Harbor, Petersburg, the 1864 Shenandoah Valley campaign, and Appomattox.<br>In A Surgeon's Civil War, the educated and articulate Holt describes camp life, army politics, and the medical difficulties that he and his colleagues experienced. His reminiscences and letters provide an insider's look at medicine as practiced on the battlefield and offer occasional glimpses of the efficacy of Surgeon General William A. Hammond's reforms as they affected Holt's regiment. He also comments on other subject, including slavery and national events. Holt served until October 17, 1864, when ill health forced him to resign.</p><p>A helpful addition to the histories of both medicine and the Civil War. From rural New York, Holt served with the 121st New York Infantry from September 1862 until October 1864, when he was granted a medical leave because of the tuberculosis that three years later ended his life. His letters to his wife and the diary he kept from May to October 1864 describe daily life in the army, with its boredom, frustration, flashes of intense activity, and occasional fear and terror. Holt's accounts of the fighting at Cold Harbor and in other battles present graphic descriptions of woundings and deaths; of courage, cowardice, and disjointedness; and especially of the appalling sights, odors, and sounds not only during the fighting but for days afterward. Gratifyingly, the editors' introductions and footnotes achieve just the right balance of pertinent information and context setting; they neither overwhelm the reader nor leave valid questions unanswered. <i>William Beatty</i></p><h2>Guidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Programs</h2><p><p><i>Guidelines for Cardiac Rehabilitation and Secondary Prevention Programs, Fifth Edition With Web Resource</i>, covers the entire scope of practice for cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention (CR/SP) programs.

The chapter order is exactly how I would want my students to progress throughout the course. The description of treatment methods is explanatory without being tedious, and the case examples are perfectly interspersed throughout the text to serve as lecture breaks for discussion. By far the most impressive aspect of the text is the practical advice provided. The numerous examples of how one would deal with a traumatized child in the real world, in actual therapeutic sessions, are most helpful....I cannot praise this work highly enough...The authors effectively convey the message that it is possible to make a positive impact in the life of a child who has seen so much pain and misery.

First published in 1974, it has remained the classic text on a significant form of music making and composing that developed alongside, and partly in opposition to, the postwar modernist tradition of composers such as Boulez, Berio, or Stockhausen. The experimentalist par excellence was John Cage whose legendary 4&#39; 33&#39;&#39; consists of four minutes and thirty three seconds of silence to be performed on any instrument. Such pieces have a conceptual rather than purely musical starting point and radically challenge conventional notions of the musical work. Nyman&#39;s book traces the revolutionary attitudes that were developed toward concepts of time, space, sound, and composer/performer responsibility. It was within the experimental tradition that the seeds of musical minimalism were sown and the book contains reference to the early works of Reich, Riley, Young, and Glass.

One would become one of the most famous volumes of poetry in American history, a free-verse revelation beloved the world over, <i>Leaves of Grass</i>.

In this ambitious new history, Estelle Freedman demonstrates that our definition of rape has depended heavily on dynamics of political power and social privilege.</p><p>The long-dominant view of rape in America envisioned a brutal attack on a chaste white woman by a male stranger, usually an African American. From the early nineteenth century, advocates for women's rights and racial justice challenged this narrow definition and the sexual and political power of white men that it sustained. Between the 1870s and the 1930s, at the height of racial segregation and lynching, and amid the campaign for woman suffrage, women's rights supporters and African American activists tried to expand understandings of rape in order to gain legal protection from coercive sexual relations, assaults by white men on black women, street harassment, and the sexual abuse of children. By redefining rape, they sought to redraw the very boundaries of citizenship.</p><p>Freedman narrates the victories, defeats, and limitations of these and other reform efforts. The modern civil rights and feminist movements, she points out, continue to grapple with both the insights and the dilemmas of these first campaigns to redefine rape in American law and culture.</p></p><p>Estelle B. Freedman is Edgar E. Robinson Professor in United States History at Stanford University.<b>Freedman</b>&#x2019;s narrative is not simply relevant; it provides a sophisticated understanding of why rape is something we have been debating for centuries... This book is an ambitious and highly successful project. In clear prose filled with riveting anecdotes and powerful stories, Freedman recounts the story of rape, its wounds, its discontents and our as-yet-incomplete march to its end. (Imani Perry <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> 2013-09-13)<br><br>[<b>Freedman</b>] does more than merely chronicle the distressing history of racism in the U.S. between the 1870s and the 1930s. She is engaged in a meticulous analysis of the responses of various civil rights movements to pervasive sexual violence against women, girls and young boys... Even when the rape of black women was acknowledged, it was in the context of the harm done to black men&#x2019;s pride: lynching (of men) rather than rape (of women) became the symbol of African American subjugation. By focusing on protest against oppression, Freedman gives readers an intellectually complex exposition of racial politics in America. (Joanna Bourke <i>Times Higher Education</i> 2013-10-18)<br><br>This stunning U.S. history demonstrates that power and privilege fundamentally shape the meanings of rape&#x2015;its legal definitions, cultural representations, and human impact. Focusing especially on 1850&#x2013;1950, <b>Freedman</b> argues that rape and citizenship are inextricably bound. Contests over who may&#x2015;and may not&#x2015;claim protection from sexual violence and accusations of rape illustrate this. Connections to broader histories of racial, class, and gender injustice drew attention to activists&#x2019; work, and Freedman deserves praise for critically examining their different attitudes and aspirations. She also astutely acknowledges regional differences in legal constructions, representations, and experiences of rape and sexual violence. Insightful critiques of sodomy laws, male youth, and men of color distinguish this book... This important, timely work should draw a diverse readership. (S.

(Darlene Clark Hine, Board of Trustees Professor of African American Studies and Professor of History, Northwestern University)<br><br><b>Freedman</b> eloquently demonstrates that changing understandings of who is likely to rape, and who is likely to be the victim, have been at the core of the troubled histories of racial and sexual injustice.

As she tracks evolving views of what constituted rape and who was to blame, <b>Freedman</b> illuminates American inequalities&#x2015;of class, age, gender, and especially race&#x2015;from wholly unexpected angles. A must for anyone concerned with equity in the American polity. (Nancy F. Cott, author of <i>Public Vows: A History of Marriage and the Nation</i>)<br><br><b>Freedman</b> shows how, since the country&#x2019;s founding, ideas about sexual violence have traditionally been informed--and enforced--by and for a ruling class of white men. She also outlines the history of anti-rape movements that challenged white supremacy and male supremacy. The presentation of these disparate movements, which were often at odds with one another despite having seemingly similar goals, is among the most fascinating aspects of Freedman&#x2019;s narrative...Throughout history there has been no cohesive anti-rape movement, and <i>Redefining Rape </i>makes the reasons for that clear. By cataloguing the many disparate critiques of the popular definitions of rape over time, Freedman has placed a largely invisible history of anti-rape reform in the broader context of ongoing struggles for social equality in the United States...For anyone interested in undertaking intersectional, anti-racist feminist action against sexual violence, <i>Redefining Rape </i>has a lot to offer. Freedman does a great service in providing a historical account of where we came from, how we got here, and lessons for how to do it better in the future.

The demands and expectations of us, and those we place on ourselves, can be overwhelming. While trying to navigate this thing called &#x201c;life,&#x201d; have you ever longed for a close friend, confidant, or mentor to walk alongside you and encourage you in Biblical womanhood? Debbie Morris did. And yet even as a young minister&#x2019;s wife, she found herself without someone to fill this all-important role. So she turned to the Bible. Biblical women such as Eve, Sarah, and Miriam had always fascinated her. But now they also became her friends, sisters, and teachers. Through their stories, the Holy Spirit revealed how their lives&#x2014;both joys and struggles&#x2014;weren&#x2019;t that much different from ours today and how they can teach women today to be a grace-filled, life-giving woman of God.<br> &nbsp;<br> In <i>The Blessed Woman,</i> Debbie invites you to learn from these women as well. As she shares her own stories and the stories of discerning women in the Bible, she addresses topics such as overcoming insecurity, finding purpose, establishing priorities, letting go, and waiting. <i>The Blessed Woman</i> reminds us how God longs for every woman to experience His tenderness&#x2014;and to know the true meaning of being blessed.</p><p><b>Debbie Morris</b> is the executive pastor of women&#x2019;s ministry at Gateway Church, a multi-campus church in the Dallas/Fort Worth metroplex. Since it began in 2000, the church has grown to more than 24,000 active members. Debbie has been married for more than thirty years to Gateway&#x2019;s founding senior pastor, Robert Morris, and they have three grown children.Life Springs<br><br>Adam lay with his wife Eve, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, &#x201c;With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man.&#x201d; Genesis 4:1 (niv)<br><br>Being a woman isn&#x2019;t always easy. Most of us discover this early in life. But every once in a while, the full realization dawns on us with startling clarity.<br><br>For me, the wake-up call came when I was on my way to the hospital about to give birth to my first baby. What an eye-opening trip that was! I&#x2019;d lumbered to the car feeling calm and competent. Having spent months preparing for the event, I assumed I was ready. Baby showers, doctor&#x2019;s appointments, and chats with other women about the thrills and<br>chills of childbearing had left me feeling supported, informed, and able to navigate the natal experience ahead.<br><br>Somewhere between home and the hospital admittance desk, however, my confidence dwindled. Looking down at the rotundity that nine months earlier had been my lap, I wondered if I was really ready for this after all. My heart skipped to a quicker pace as I considered my options. Clearly, I had none.<br><br>There was no way out of this. I couldn&#x2019;t change my mind. I couldn&#x2019;t delegate this task and ask somebody else to finish it for me. I couldn&#x2019;t even procrastinate. Like it or not, ready or not, I&#x2019;m going to give birth to this baby today, I thought. And I have no idea how to do it!<br><br>Glancing at my husband, Robert, in the driver&#x2019;s seat, as he confidently gripped the steering wheel and maneuvered his way through traffic, didn&#x2019;t do much to reassure me. He didn&#x2019;t know any more about this than I did. Yes, he could deliver me to the delivery room, all right. But from that point on, he wasn&#x2019;t going to be much help.<br><br>Actually, that&#x2019;s not just a personal observation. It&#x2019;s scriptural as well. As I realized some years later, I was experiencing a little of what Eve did when she gave birth to the very first child ever born. Her description of the event was simple but revealing: &#x201c;With the help of the Lord I have brought forth a man&#x201d; (Genesis 4:1, niv).<br><br>Notice, Eve made no mention of Adam. Apparently, whatever assistance he attempted to give wasn&#x2019;t worth mentioning. (Some things never change.) From Eve&#x2019;s perspective, the only one there who truly made a difference was the Lord. God alone could provide what she needed to meet the challenge of becoming the mother of the entire human race.<br>Eve&#x2019;s story is so familiar to us that we often take it for granted. But can you really imagine what pregnancy and childbirth must have been like for her? Think of the questions she must have had! Unlike women today, Eve had no example to follow, no mother or sister to explain what was happening to her during those mysterious nine months. She had no books to read about the baby&#x2019;s development, no childbirth classes to prepare her, no friends to share their experiences of labor and delivery.<br><br>When Eve&#x2019;s birth pangs began, nurses weren&#x2019;t hovering around her, timing her contractions and reassuring her that everything was going fine. She didn&#x2019;t have a midwife to rub her back and put ice chips in her mouth. Doctors weren&#x2019;t tending to her, as they did to me when I delivered my first child, with the efficiency that comes from years of training and experience.<br><br>Yet even so, according to the Bible and her own words, Eve was not alone. The all-knowing, all-powerful, all-loving God was there to coach her, comfort her, and counsel her. And with His help, she did what she was created to do. She fulfilled the mission that had been divinely woven into her very DNA.<br><br>Eve stepped into the calling defined by her name, which means living or enliven, and brought forth life.<br><br>Can Anybody Show Me How to Do This?<br><br>As God&#x2019;s women, we&#x2019;ve been getting pregnant and giving birth, following in Eve&#x2019;s footsteps, ever since. Not only have we birthed children, but we have also birthed all kinds of life-generating things: hopes and dreams, ministries and careers, books and businesses. The list could go on and on. But all too often, we&#x2019;ve had to walk out the process the same way Eve did: pretty much alone, with only God to help us.<br><br>I know what that&#x2019;s like. When I first married Robert and the dream of ministry was conceived in our hearts, I didn&#x2019;t have any mentors&#x2014;and I needed them badly. As a nineteen-year-old bride, plagued with insecurities that had nagged me all my life, I had no idea how to nurture and give birth to the plans God had for us.<br><br>Our lives before marriage looked nothing like they do now. Although Robert had rededicated his life a number of times in the Baptist church he attended, he really hadn&#x2019;t been serious about committing his life to Christ. After one such rededication, someone at the church who knew he&#x2019;d had a problem with drugs suggested he date a &#x201c;good girl&#x201d; to help keep him on the right track. So I was elected&#x2014;that&#x2019;s what brought us together.<br><br>The first time we went out together, we double-dated with my sister and her boyfriend. They hadn&#x2019;t yet kissed, and her boyfriend had predetermined that this date would mark the big event. Thus, as soon as the date was over, Robert and I quickly disappeared and left them alone. Slipping around the house to the back door, we started to say our good-byes when suddenly my father surprised us, thinking we were vandals or thieves. Wearing only his underwear&#x2014;yes, the tighty-whitey kind&#x2014;he said with a dignity that belied his attire, &#x201c;Deb, it&#x2019;s time to come in.&#x201d;<br><br>Mortified, I muttered, &#x201c;Okay, Daddy,&#x201d; thinking the date was over. Boy was I wrong! After my father closed the door, Robert kissed me and my whole life changed.<br><br>Shortly after we began dating, a local evangelist saw potential in Robert. He took Robert under his wing and opened doors for him to entertain church youth groups with funny skits and to share his testimony. By the time we got married, Robert was already preaching. There was just one problem: he didn&#x2019;t really know God.<br><br>Just nine months after our wedding, our marriage was in trouble and I had no idea what to do to fix it. Robert was miserable. I realize now he was under conviction, but at the time I thought it was my fault. As a new bride, eager to please my husband and be a good wife, I wondered in desperation, What am I doing wrong?<br><br>Thank God, one night after preaching a borrowed sermon based on the Matthew 13 parable about the wheat and the tares, Robert began to realize he wasn&#x2019;t saved. He gave his heart to Jesus the next day and was rapidly and radically transformed.<br><br>Although things got a little better at that point, life was still hard. I faced changes and challenges that left me reeling. We had recently moved to a new city where I had only a couple of friends. Robert traveled all the time in ministry, so I went by myself every Sunday to the class for young married believers. I felt like a misfit without my husband at my side. And despite both of us working forty to sixty hours a week, our combined income totaled only six hundred dollars a month.<br><br>I knew Robert had a strong call of God on his life. I also sensed that my role, like Eve&#x2019;s, was to help bring it forth.<br><br>But how?<br><br>Honestly, I had no clue.<br><br>Like every woman, I needed a mentor. I wanted someone to walk alongside me, to love me and show me how to get where I needed to go. But I didn&#x2019;t really have anyone. My wonderful mother just wasn&#x2019;t the right person for me to talk to at that point in my life. (Now I have a married daughter of my own and I understand why that&#x2019;s not always best.)<br>Months later I began working in the offices of James Robison&#x2019;s ministry; while I admired his wife, Betty, from afar, I hardly felt like I could pick up the phone and say, &#x201c;Hi, Betty! Would you mind being my mentor?&#x201d; So I did the only thing I knew to do. I turned to the Bible.<br><br>Having memorized Proverbs 31 before I got married, I started asking God to teach me how to be a godly wife. He answered by turning my attention to the women of the Bible. Of course! I thought. Ever since my childhood, the characters of the Scriptures have appealed to me. I&#x2019;ve never been captivated as much by theology (although I appreciate its value), but I&#x2019;m fascinated by biblical people and their stories.<br><br>As I read and studied about women like Eve, Mary, Sarah, Miriam, and Zipporah, the Holy Spirit began talking to me about them. They became like friends and sisters and teachers. Their examples came alive and the Lord turned them into my mentors. Determined to learn everything I could, to gain all the tips and insights these women had to offer,<br>I found I could grow through their experiences. I discovered, one revelation at a time, what they could teach me about becoming a grace-filled, life-giving woman of God.<br><br>You might say they began to give me grace lessons. Lessons I would be learning and living for the rest of my life.</p><h2>Jazz Chants for Children: Student Book</h2><p>A collection of chants, songs, and poems designed to teach the rhythms of spoken American English primarily to students of English as a second language.</p><p>Carolyn Graham is the creator of Jazz Chants, which connect the rhythm of spoken American English to the beatof jazz.

In it, Thomas Robson, a chef from Vancouver, British Columbia, presents a vivid travelogue in words and color photos (all related to his television show of the same name) that highlight the 50 recipes presented on the show. The pictures bring to life the adventure and visual feast of local markets, with fat bundles of green, slim scallions heaped next to baskets of glistening fish and crocks brimming with mysterious-looking seasoning pastes. Photos of grilled satays accompanied by coconut-milk-rich Thai Peanut Sauce and Braised Prawns, stir-fried with ginger and Chinese rice wine, tempt you to head for any Asian market within your reach. Chinese Broccoli and Prawn Salad and Thai Corn Cakes call on simple techniques that most cooks will be comfortable with, while more complex dishes like Cantonese Clay Pot Rice will reward moore involved concentration.<p> This authentic Asian cooking does require some access to particular ingredients. Besides fresh produce and seasonings like Kaffir lime leaves, you may need bottled fish sauce, canned coconut milk, and other staples to make authentic dishes from scratch. Anyone who can get the Canadian line of Asian Home Gourmet Spice Pastes (a clearly acknowledged sponsor of Robson's show and this book) will enjoy shortcuts in blending some ingredients.</p><p> Do not miss the Thai Pineapple Rice. Accompanying culinary information with background on Asian culture, Robson explains that this dish, stuffed into a fresh pineapple, serves as a birthday cake in Thailand, with guests gathering around it to sing happy birthday. <i>--Dana Jacobi</i></p>Thomas Robson, a Vancouver-based, classically trained chef, is co-founder of La Maison Sanguinet Ecole de Cuisine in Montreal.

The author of the Girls of Slender Means and The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, she makes her home on Italy.Spark's autobiography takes her from her Edinburgh childhood in the 20's to just after the publication of her first novel, The Comforters, in the 50's. Along the way come her half-Jewish family; school (and a portrait of Spark's beloved teacher, Miss Kay--the model for Miss Jean Brodie); a disastrous early marriage culminating in a prewar move to Rhodesia with her increasingly unbalanced husband; the birth of her son; divorce; wartime life in London doing work on the literary outskirts (e.g., directing the Poetry Society--an experience for which she took enormous factional grief but that she would later use in Loitering with Intent); and first writings and publications of her own. This memoir, Sparks says, is primarily to correct other critical versions of her life- -mainly Derrick Stanford's Muriel Spark--and there is to it, therefore, a bristling edge. But it rarely seems defensive--eelish, maybe, but not defensive: Spark's relationship to her son (raised mostly by her parents in Edinburgh) and to the Catholic faith she converted to are dispatched with an air of hardly-any-of-your-business. Cagey though it is, Spark's book will please her admirers all the same. Describing the Border ballads' ``steel and bite...so remorseful and yet so lyrical'' is to give a remarkable capsule of her own special fictional art--and the seriousness, comedy, and relatively depersonalized intimacy expressed here are completely congruent with the best of her work.

It is an anatomy of film criticism meant to reset the agenda for film scholarship. As such <i>Making Meaning</i> should be a landmark book, a focus for debate from which future film study will evolve.</p><p>Bordwell systematically maps different strategies for interpreting films and making meaning, illustrating his points with a vast array of examples from Western film criticism. Following an introductory chapter that sets out the terms and scope of the argument, Bordwell goes on to show how critical institutions constrain and contain the very practices they promote, and how the interpretation of texts has become a central preoccupation of the humanities. He gives lucid accounts of the development of film criticism in France, Britain, and the United States since World War II; analyzes this development through two important types of criticism, thematic-explicatory and symptomatic; and shows that both types, usually seen as antithetical, in fact have much in common. These diverse and even warring schools of criticism share conventional, rhetorical, and problem-solving techniques&#x2015;a point that has broad-ranging implications for the way critics practice their art. The book concludes with a survey of the alternatives to criticism based on interpretation and, finally, with the proposal that a historical poetics of cinema offers the most fruitful framework for film analysis.</p></p><p>Few books of film criticism are as daring and controversial as <i>Making Meaning.</i> In the tradition of Terry Eagleton's <i>Literary Theory: An Introduction</i> and Fredric Jameson's <i>The Political Unconscious</i>, David Bordwell looks back at the work done in his field, summarizes its strengths, criticizes its weaknesses, and proposes a new point of departure. The result is an arresting overview of contemporary film theory that also exposes its shortcomings. Bordwell concludes that most film criticism and theory is tied to the idea of making meaning, unpacking the overt or hidden messages that lie within the movie. Prophesying that a new era of analysis is before us, Bordwell calls for film scholarship that will both complement and transcend mere interpretation.This book is at once a history of film criticism, and analysis of how critics interpret films, and suggestion for some alternative research programs. I want to describe how an institution constructs and constrains what is thought and said by its members, and how the members solve routine problems by producing acceptable discourse.</p><h2>The New Retirementality: Planning Your Life and Living Your Dreams...at Any Age You Want</h2><p><b>Stop making a living and start making a life with <i>The New Retirementality</i></b> <p>When Mitch Anthony first presented the concept of a new way of thinking about retirement in 2000, it was novel and many critics didn't buy into it.

Its fledgling fleet had been virtually annihilated during the War of Independence and was mostly trapped in port by the end of the War of 1812. How this meager presence became the major naval power it remains to this day is the subject of <i>American Naval History, 1607&#x2013;1865: Overcoming the Colonial Legacy</i>. A wide-ranging yet concise survey of the U.S. Navy from the colonial era through the Civil War, the book draws on American, British, and French history to reveal how navies reflect diplomatic, political, economic, and social developments and to show how the foundation of America&#x2019;s future naval greatness was laid during the Civil War.</p><p>Award-winning author Jonathan R. Dull documents the remarkable transformation of the U.S. Navy between 1861 and 1865, thanks largely to brilliant naval officers like David Farragut, David D. Porter, and Andrew Foote; visionary politicians like Abraham Lincoln and Gideon Welles; and progressive industrialists like James Eads and John Ericsson. But only by understanding the failings of the antebellum navy can the accomplishments of Lincoln&#x2019;s navy be fully appreciated. Exploring such topics as delays in American naval development, differences between the U.S. and European fleets, and the effect that the country&#x2019;s colonial past had on its naval policies, Dull offers a new perspective on both American naval history and the history of the developing republic.<br></p></p><p>Jonathan R.

Dull has pulled personalities, diplomacy, technology, and politics into a nicely executed summary.

It, and its origins have been studied more intensively than any other period in American history, yet it remains profoundly controversial. Brian Holden Reid&#39;s formidable volume is a major contribution to this ongoing historical debate. Based on a wealth of primary research, it examines every aspect of the origins of the conflict and addresses key questions such as was it an avoidable tragedy, or a necessary catharsis for a divided nation? How far was slavery the central issue? Why should the conflict have errupted into violence and why did it not escalate into world war?</p><p><p>This impressive volume - one of the most eagerly awaited additions to a famous series - treats with appropriate amplitude and authority the origins of one of the most terrible conflicts of modern times. The American Civil War was the bloodiest war of the nineteenth century. In its mingling of ideology and self-interest, and in the destructiveness of its weaponry, the extent of its casualties, the degree to which resources on both sides had to be mobilised for the war effort, and, not least, in the way the realities of warfare were brought home - literally - into the drawing rooms and parlours of the American people and far beyond, it can claim not only to prefigure modern warfare but itself to be the first distinctively modern war.<br> <br>Why did it happen? Was it an avoidable tragedy precipitated by irresponsible demagogues, or a necessary refining fire for a divided nation? To what extent was slavery the central issue, or was it a front for less principled passions and rivalries? How far did those who presided over the countdown to violence foresee the outcome, and the scale and horror of what would ensue? Brian Holden Reid sets out to answer these and other questions in his survey of the events preceding the outbreak of war in 1861, and of the vast literature to which they have since given rise. <br> <br>Reconsidering the much-analysed political controversies of the 1840s and 1850s, he argues that the political differences between North and South cannot by themelves explain the coming of war. Familiar as we are with what happened, we can too easily overlook the gulf that lies in practice between casting a vote and firing on a uniformed enemy. He reminds us throughout of the enormity, rather than the inevitability, of that transition. He devotes two chapters to developing a 'model' to explain the escalation of violence that culminated in the firing of the first shots at Fort Sumter; and - writing from outside the United States, and seeing the conflict in a broader context than, understandably, many domestic historians have done - he also considers why a conflict with such huge international ramifications did not further escalate into a full-scale world war.<br> <br>The period has been studied more intensively than any other in American history, which in itself would justify this exhaustive review of the main areas of controversy. But Brian Holden Reid's book is far more than just a synthesis. Based on a wealth of primary research,it makes its own substantial contribution to the historical debate. Written with an exhilarating vigour that makes light of its length, it is a formidable achievement. <br>____________________________________________________________________________ <br> <br>BRIAN HOLDEN REID is Senior Lecturer in War Studies at King's College, London, and Resident Historian at the British Army Staff College, Camberley<br> </p>Brian Holden Reid is Senior Lecturer in War Studies at King&#39;s College, London, and Resident Historian at the British Army Staff College, Camberley.</p><h2>The Handbook of Commodity Investing (Frank J.

The gentle linen weaver, Silas Marner, exiles himself to the town of Raveloe after being falsely accused of a heinous theft. There he begins to find redemption and spiritual rebirth through his unselfish love for an abandoned child he discovers in his isolated cottage.</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction. The series will be extensive and open-ended and will provide school students with a range of edited texts taken from a wide geographical spread.Embittered by a false accusation, disappointed in friendship and love, the weaver Silas Marner retreats into a long twilight life alone with his loom. . . and his gold. Silas hoards a treasure that kills his spirit until fate steals it from him and replaces it with a golden-haired founding child. Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, &#34;Our Mutual Friend revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#39;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#34;Noddy&#34; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#34;the Golden Dustman.&#34; Charles Dickens&#39;s last complete novel, &#34;Our Mutual Friend encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, &#34;Our Mutual Friend is one of Dickens&#39;s most complex--and satisfying--novels.</p><h2>John Knox</h2><p>Jane Dawson has written the definitive life of John Knox, a leader of the Protestant Reformation in sixteenth-century Scotland. Based in large part on previously unavailable sources, including the recently discovered papers of Knox&#x2019;s close friend and colleague Christopher Goodman, Dawson&#x2019;s biography challenges the traditionally held stereotype of this founder of the Presbyterian denomination as a strident and misogynist religious reformer whose influence rarely extended beyond Scotland. She maintains instead that John Knox relied heavily on the support of his &#x201c;godly sisters&#x201d; and conferred as well as argued with Mary, Queen of Scots. He was a proud member of the European community of Reformed Churches and deeply involved in the religious Reformations within England, Ireland, France, Switzerland, and the Holy Roman Empire. Casting a surprising new light on the public and private personas of a highly complex, difficult, and hugely compelling individual, Dawson&#x2019;s fascinating study offers a vivid, fully rounded portrait of this renowned Scottish preacher and prophet who had a seismic impact on religion and society.</p><p>In this definitive new biography of British preacher, prophet, and reformer John Knox, Jane Dawson shatters the myths, misconceptions, and stereotypes surrounding the controversial leader of the Protestant Reformation in sixteenth-century Scotland.<b>Jane Dawson</b> is John Laing Professor of Reformation History, School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh.

It was intended to comprise translations into English of all the extant works of the Fathers (with the exception of the more bulky works of Origen) down to the date of the first General Council held at Nicaea in 325 A.D. This American edition by Arthur Cleveland Coxe is a revision of the original series edited by Alexander Roberts and Sir James Donaldson and published in Edinburgh. The revision involves a major rearrangement to conform to the historical sequence, the addition of brief introductions and notes indicating variances in readings, specifying references to scripture or literature, clarifying obscure passages, and noting corruptions or distortions of patristic testimony (as forged in the Decretals). The basic aim of the translations has been to strive for literary exactness, placing the English reader as nearly as possible on an equal footing with those who are able to read the original.<p>Volume Titles:<br>Volume 1: Apostolic Fathers, Justin Martyr, Inrenaeus<br>Volume 2: Hermas, Tatian, Athenagoras, Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria<br>Volume 3: Tertullian<br>Volume 4: Tertullian (IV), Minucius Felix, Commodian, Origen<br>Volume 5: Hippolytus, Cyprian, Caius, Novatian, Appendix<br>Volume 6: Gregory Thaumaturgus, Dionysius the Great, Julius Africanus, Anatolius and Minor Writers, Methodius, Arnobius<br>Volume 7: Lactantius, Venantius, Asterius, Victorinus, Dionysius, Apostolic Teaching and Constitutions, Homily, and Liturgies<br>Volume 8: Twelve Patriarchs, Excerpts and Epistles, The Clementina, Aprocryphal Gospels and Acts, Syriac Documents<br>Volume 9: Gospel of Peter, Diatessaron, Testament of Abraham, Epistles of Clement, Origen and Miscellaneous Works<br>Volume 10: Bibliography, General Index, Annotated Index of Authors and Works</p></p><p></p><h2>Kant: Perpetual Peace</h2><p>Between states... no punitive war is thinkable because between them a relation of superior and inferior does not exist. Whence it follows that a war of extermination, where the process of annihilation would strike both parties at once and all right as well, would bring out perpetual peace only in the great graveyard of the human race. -from &#34;Perpetual Peace&#34; One of the most influential thinkers of the Western civilization, a man who profoundly shaped the mind-set of the modern world, examines war and human nature and concludes, bracingly, that global peace is inevitable. Far from an unattainable utopian fantasy, this 1795 essay lays out the requirements for peace, including republican governments, freedom of movement for citizens, and-prophetically-the formation of a league of nations. In this era of imperialistic ambitions and preemptive wars, Kant&#39;s insight is a profound reminder that peace is possible but must be actively pursued. Also available from Cosimo Classics: Kant&#39;s Analytic of the Beautiful and Perpetual Peace. German metaphysician IMMANUEL KANT (1724-1804) served as a librarian of the Royal Library, a prestigious government position, and as a professor at K�nigsberg University. His other works include Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime (1764), Critique of Pure Reason (1781), and Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (1785).</p><p>Library of Liberal Arts title.Immanuel Kant was a philosopher, with a philosophy that seems singularly unlikely to encourage a philosopher to take history seriously. The intelligible world under universal moral law and the world of nature under universal causal law seem the upper and lower millstones of this philosophy, between which all life would be crushed out of history.</p><h2>The New Metaphysicals: Spirituality and the American Religious Imagination</h2><p>American spirituality&#x2014;with its focus on individual meaning, experience, and exploration&#x2014;is usually thought to be a product of the postmodern era. But, as <i>The New Metaphysicals</i> makes clear, contemporary American spirituality has historic roots in the nineteenth century and a great deal in common with traditional religious movements. To explore this world, Courtney Bender combines research into the history of the movement with fieldwork in Cambridge, Massachusetts&#x2014;a key site of alternative religious inquiry from Emerson and William James to today. Through her ethnographic analysis, Bender discovers that a focus on the new, on progress, and on the way spiritual beliefs intersect with science obscures the historical roots of spirituality from its practitioners and those who study it alike&#x2014;and shape an enduring set of modern religious possibilities in the process.</p><p>Courtney Bender is associate professor of religion at Columbia University&#34;Truly distinctive and distinguished. This is a remarkable book simply for recording these fascinating practitioners and helping readers understand their categories of experience in all their complexity. But her work does far more than merely record; it offers a compelling examination of how we may think anew about these categories and the people - metaphysicals and scholars alike - for whom they matter. Hilarious and humane all at once: it&#39;s a rare mix, and Bender hits the mark again and again.&#34; - R.

Their values, well-expressed in the motto of the Cretan writer Kazantzakis--'I hope for nothing; I fear nothing; I am free'--made them heroes at times when such qualities were positively endorsed in a Greece fighting to escape foreign domination. Today inevitably they are frowned on; Cretan shepherds are now caricatured as 'goat thieves and knife pullers', a survival of primitivism outrageous in a modern state. Herzfeld's excellent and sensitive ethnography of the pseudonymous village and inhabitants of Glendi, a mountain village in central Crete, is concerned with just these attributes, the ways they are lived and reproduced among Glendiots."<b>---Olivia Harris, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i></b></p><h2>The Great Stone Face</h2><p>As the years pass and his small village grows, Ethan watches for the fulfillment of the prophecy that someone born looking like the Great Stone Face up on the mountain will be the greatest, noblest person of his time.</p><p>Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.""Do you know the prophecy?" asked Pastor Hooper.<br>Ethan nodded. "Someone will be born hereabouts who will look just like<br>the Great Stone Face, and he will be the noblest person of his time."<p>Ethan grows up in the shadow of The Great Stone Face. With everyone else in his village, he waits and wonders who will fulfill the prophecy. One by one, men of wealth and power are believed to be the likeness of the Great Stone Face, but as the years go by each one disappoints. Ethan begins to believe the prophecy will not be fulfilled in his lifetime, until a young child, seeing more deeply than all the rest, reveals the truth . . .</p><p>Gary Schmidt's retelling of this classic story by Nathaniel Hawthorne is a moving look at the nature of goodness and a life well-lived. And Bill Farnsworth has beautifully captured the period and the tale's New England setting with images in the tradition of the Golden Age of Illustration.</p></p><h2>Wayward Women: Sexuality and Agency in a New Guinea Society</h2><p>Written with uncommon grace and clarity, this extremely engaging ethnography analyzes female agency, gendered violence, and transactional sex in contemporary Papua New Guinea. Focusing on Huli &#x201c;passenger women,&#x201d; (women who accept money for sex) <i>Wayward Women </i>explores the socio-economic factors that push women into the practice of transactional sex, and asks how these transactions might be an expression of resistance, or even revenge. Challenging conventional understandings of &#x201c;prostitution&#x201d; and &#x201c;sex work,&#x201d; Holly Wardlow contextualizes the actions and intentions of passenger women in a rich analysis of kinship, bridewealth, marriage, and exchange, revealing the ways in which these robust social institutions are transformed by an encompassing capitalist economy. Many passenger women assert that they have been treated <i>&#x201c;olsem maket&#x201d; </i>(like market goods) by their husbands and natal kin, and they respond by fleeing home and defiantly appropriating their sexuality for their own purposes. Experiences of rape, violence, and the failure of kin to redress such wrongs figure prominently in their own stories about becoming &#x201c;wayward.&#x201d; Drawing on village court cases, hospital records, and women&#x2019;s own raw, caustic , and darkly funny narratives, <i>Wayward Women</i> provides a riveting portrait of the way modernity engages with gender to produce new and contested subjectivities.</p><p>"<i>Wayward Women</i> is ethnography of the highest order from a region where anthropologists have provided works of singular merit since the days of Malinowski. The data are immensely rich and the analysis measured and balanced. References to theory illuminate accounts of daily life. The reader has a sense of witnessing and understanding the events alongside the author. This is a marvelous book."&#x2015;Shirley Lindenbaum, co-editor of <i>Knowledge, Power, and Practice: The Anthropology of Medicine and Everyday Life</i><br><br>"This is a highly original study of 'sex-work' in a Papua New Guinea society, written with great clarity and grace. At its core is a carefully rendered account of the way Huli 'passenger women' understand their motivations in relation to local bridewealth and kinship systems. <i>Wayward Women</i> is one of the finest accounts we have of women's experiences of marriage exchange systems anywhere in the world, and it is by far the most detailed and best-rendered account we have from modern Papua New Guinea. It is also a very substantial contribution to theoretical work in both anthropology and gender studies."&#x2015;Joel Robbins, author of <i>Becoming Sinners: Christianity and Moral Torment in a Papua New Guinea Society</i><b>Holly Wardlow</b> is Assistant Professor of Anthropology at the University of Toronto.</p><h2>Anatomy of Fitness Pilates</h2><p>Pilates is a rewarding and invigorating exercise program that can increase overall fitness, build core strength, and improve performance.

So it is in this Christian classic by the late pastor and evangelist A. W. Tozer. He brings the mystics to bear on modern spirituality, grieving the hustle and bustle and calling for a slow, steady gaze upon God. With prophetic vigor and flowing prose, he urges us to replace low thoughts of God with lofty ones, to quiet our lives so we can know God's presence. He reminds us that life apart from God is really no life at all.&nbsp;</p><p>Tozer writes from his knees, a posture fit for presenting the character of God in all its demanding grandeur. "Arise, O sleeper!" is his word to us, and yet if we heed the call, we will see that to arise is not to stand but to kneel before the God of heaven in humble contemplation. To pursue God is to know Him, and in our knowing, be drawn in.</p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Chemistry</h2><p><i>Chemistry</i>, Fifth Edition, by Julia Burdge offers a clear writing style written with the students in mind.

It demystifies Linux in terms familiar to Windows users and gives readers only what they need to start being successful users of Linux.<i>Learning Debian GNU/Linux</i> takes the reader step by step through the process of installing and setting up a Debian system, and provides a thorough but gentle introduction to the basics of using Debian GNU/Linux.Because the book is written specifically for the included CD, the reader needs nothing else to get started with this exciting new operating system.</p></p><p><i>Learning Debian GNU/Linux</i> assumes only that its readers have a bit of Windows or Macintosh experience, are willing to learn, and aren't afraid to do a little experimenting. From there, it provides a complete introductory-level explanation of installing and using Linux and the GHU suite of tools, focusing on the Debian 2.1 distribution to the extent that it differs from other flavors of Linux. Because it ships with a bootable CD-ROM that contains Debian 2.1, this book represents a complete Linux starter kit (and a reasonably priced one, at that).<p> The author takes a patient approach to his subject, explaining key configuration files one line at a time and walking through important procedures, such as setting up a dial-up connection to the Internet. He's also remarkably liberal with troubleshooting ideas, frequently pausing to present lists of what might have gone wrong as a result of a recently explained procedures and suggesting solutions to each. He's also careful to explain aspects of the Unix universe (such as mounting devices and running a windowing system atop a kernel) that might be unfamiliar to people accustomed to more mainstream operating systems. Like any good Linux user, McCarty is quick to share his favorite utilities and explain how to use them. <i>--David Wall</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: Installing Debian Linux and the GNU suite, installing and using the X windowing system, performing critical administration and management tasks (in graphical programs and via the bash shell), setting up a local area network (LAN), setting up the Apache Web server, and using the Debian package-management utilities.</p><p>Bill McCarty is a Professor of Information Technology at Azusa Pacific University, Azusa, California. Bill is also the author of over fifteen technical books and numerous papers and presentations. He serves as editor of the Honeynet Files department of the journal IEEE Security and Privacy, and directs the Azusa Pacific University Honeynet Research Project, which is affiliated with the Honeynet Project's Honeynet Research Alliance.

Ptolemy II Philadelphus of Egypt (reigned 285&#x2013;247) made him when still young a librarian in the new library at Alexandria; he prepared a great catalogue of its books.</p><p>Callimachus was author of much poetry and many works in prose, but not much survives. His hymns and epigrams are given with works by Aratus and Lycophron in another volume (<i>no. 129</i>) of the Loeb Classical Library. In the present volume are included fragments of the <i>Aetia</i> (Causes), aetiological legends concerning Greek history and customs; fragments of a book of <i>Iambi</i>; 147 fragments of the epic poem <i>Hecale,</i> which described Theseus's victory over the bull which infested Marathon; and other fragments.</p><p>We have no explicit information about the poet Musaeus, author of the short epic poem on <i>Hero and Leander</i>, except that he is given in some manuscripts the title Grammatikos, a teacher learned in the rhetoric, poetry and philosophy of his time. He was obviously a follower of the Egyptian poet Nonnus of Panopolis, of the fifth century AD, and his poem seems also to presuppose the <i>Paraphrase of the Psalms</i> of Pseudo-Apollinarius which can be dated to the period 460&#x2013;470.</p><p>Musaeus takes up a subject whose first detailed treatment is preserved in Ovid's <i>Heroides</i> (Epistles 18 and 19), but he presents it in a quite different manner. Among the literary antecedents to which this learned grammatikos expressly alludes, the most prominent are Books 5 and 6 of the <i>Odyssey</i> and Plato's <i>Phaedrus.</i> He draws too on the <i>Hymns</i> of Proclus and the <i>Metaphrasis of the Gospel of St. John</i> by Nonnus. He was most probably a Christian Neoplatonist writing a Christian allegory.</p></p><p>Text: English, Greek</p><h2>Human Resources Management: A Strategic Approach, 6th Edition</h2><p>This popular text written from a &#34;what human resources can do for you&#34; perspective, demonstrates how human resources fit into the organizational big picture.

Rose is a unique specialist dictionary of fourteen thousand Neo-Latin words and their usages as contained in eighteenth-century theological works of Emanuel Swedenborg.<br> &nbsp;<br> Beyond its use for scholars of Swedenborg, the <i>Lexicon</i> is also of great assistance to students and academics of history, philosophy, theology and science, and anyone who encounters texts written in Neo-Latin (the branch of Latin that was in use by learned writers and thinkers from the Renaissance period through to the Enlightenment and beyond). The <i>Lexicon</i> is beautifully and simply designed and easy to navigate. In addition to a preface by editor John Chadwick, this edition also features a new introduction by Jonathan S. Rose containing an important section on the morphology of Swedenborg&#x2019;s Neo-Latin (as distinct from the morphology of classical Latin); an appreciation of the life of John Chadwick by John Elliott; an appendix with a detailed listing of the various Latin editions of Swedenborg&#x2019;s theological works; and an appendix on Swedenborg&#x2019;s use of the Latin Bible of Sebastian Schmidt.</p><p>Dr. John Chadwick was a classical scholar who served as an editor on the <i>Oxford Latin Dictionary</i> and who is internationally renowned for his contribution to the decipherment of the ancient Minoan script, Linear B.

Her mother, the celebrated feminist writer Mary Wollstonecraft, died a few days after her birth. Her father, William Godwin, a well-known anarchist and atheist writer, tutored Mary. In 1814, when she was sixteen, she fell in love with the married poet Percy Bysshe Shelley and they eloped to France. In 1816 the couple travelled to Lake Geneva to spend the summer with the poet Byron. Mary was inspired to write &#34;Frankenstein&#34; after Byron arranged a ghost story competition during their stay. In the autumn of 1816 Shelley&#39;s pregnant wife drowned herself in the Serpentine in Hyde Park and Shelley immediately married Mary. The couple had four children together but only one son survived infancy. They lived in Italy until Percy&#39;s death in a boating accident in 1822. Mary continued to write until her death in London on February 1, 1851. She is buried in Bournemouth.</p><h2>Revolution on the Hudson: New York City and the Hudson River Valley in the American War of Independence</h2><p><p><strong>The untold story of the fight for the Hudson River Valley, control of which, both the Americans and the British firmly believed, would determine the outcome of the Revolutionary War.</strong></p><p>No part of the country was more contested during the American Revolution than New York City, the Hudson River, and the surrounding counties. Political and military leaders on both sides viewed the Hudson River Valley as the American jugular, which, if cut, would quickly bleed the rebellion to death.</p><p>So in 1776, King George III sent the largest amphibious force ever assembled to seize Manhattan and use it as a base from which to push up the Hudson River Valley for a grand rendezvous at Albany with an impressive army driving down from Canada. George Washington and every other patriot leader shared the king&#x2019;s fixation with the Hudson. Generations of American and British historians have held the same view. In fact, one of the few things that scholars have agreed upon is that the British strategy, though disastrously executed, should have been swift and effective. Until now, no one has argued that this plan of action was lunacy from the beginning.</p><p><em>Revolution on the Hudson</em> makes the bold new argument that Britain&#x2019;s attempt to cut off New England never would have worked, and that doggedly pursuing dominance of the Hudson ultimately cost the crown her colonies. It unpacks intricate military maneuvers on land and sea, introduces the personalities presiding over each side&#x2019;s strategy, and reinterprets the vagaries of colonial politics to offer a thrilling response to one of our most vexing historical questions: How could a fledgling nation have defeated the most powerful war machine of the era?</p><p>George C. Daughan&#x2015;winner of the prestigious Samuel Eliot Morrison Award for Naval Literature&#x2015;integrates the war&#x2019;s naval elements with its political, military, economic, and social dimensions to create a major new study of the American Revolution. Revolution on the Hudson offers a much clearer understanding of our founding conflict, and how it transformed a rebellion that Britain should have crushed into a war they could never win.</p></p><p>George C. Daughan holds a PhD from Harvard University, where he studied under Henry Kissinger. One of his previous books, If By Sea, won the Samuel Eliot Morison Award for Naval Literature, and he has been honored with the Samuel Eliot Morison Award from the USS Constitution Museum for his work as a naval scholar. He lives in New Hampshire.&#x201c;In this fresh, vivid, and often surprising telling of the Revolutionary War, George Daughan explores the timeless theme of hubris and the critical role of geography in the making of American independence.

Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.</p><h2>Nineteenth-Century American Art (Oxford History of Art)</h2><p>This innovative introduction examines the profession of the nineteenth-century American artist and audience reception of their work. Works of art by familiar names such as Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer are discussed in detail within the larger arena of visual culture, as are key works by recently discovered artists such as Harriet Hosmer. The thematic approach focuses on portraiture, landscape painting, the American West, and commemorative art, then goes on to examine the ways in which painters responded to major social and economic changes resulting from the rapid transformation from an agriculturally-based former colony to an industrialized imperial power with an evolving democracy.</p><p><br>Professor of Art History at Ohio State University, Barbara Groseclose writes about eighteenth and nineteenth-century art and literature; her most recent book is <em>British Sculpture and the Company Raj: Church Monuments and Public Statuary in Madras, Calcutta, and Bombay to 1858</em> (1995). In 1994 she was appointed a Fulbright Distinguished Chair in American Studies at the University of Utrecht.<br>This latest addition to the Oxford "History of Art" series is no less a gem than most of its predecessors. Groseclose (art history, Ohio State Univ.) presents an intelligent and penetrating survey of 19th-century American art that not only imparts an understanding of the major aspects but also questions the historical interpretations of American artistic intent and result. Major and lesser-known artists are presented under a thematic arrangement that examines portraiture, landscape painting, the American West, democracy, and commemorative art. Throughout, Groseclose places the art and artists firmly in the larger context of a politically and economically tumultuous America with a changing visual culture. Lavishly illustrated and solidly packed, the work contains a further reading list as well as a selection of pertinent art collections and web sites. The result is a wonderfully intelligent yet concise survey that challenges readers with fresh scholarship and new interpretations of familiar themes; for public, academic, and fine art libraries.

Car shoppers can wander through the showrooms of over twenty automobile makers. For marketers, differentiating products today is more challenging than at any time in history yet it remains at the heart of successful marketing. More importantly, it remains the key to a company's survival.<br> In Differentiate or Die, bestselling author Jack Trout doesn't beat around the bush. He takes marketers to task for taking the easy route too often, employing high-tech razzle-dazzle and sleight of hand when they should be working to discover and market their product's uniquely valuable qualities. He examines successful differentiation initiatives from giants like Dell Computer, Southwest Airlines, and Wal-Mart to smaller success stories like Streit's Matzoh and Connecticut's tiny Trinity College to determine why some marketers succeed at differentiating themselves while others struggle and fail.<br> More than just a collection of marketing success stories, however, Differentiate or Die is an in-depth exploration of today's most successful differentiation strategies. It explains what these strategies are, where and when they should be applied, and how they can help you carve out your own image in a crowded marketplace. Marketing executives in all types of organizations, regardless of size, can learn how to achieve product differentiation through strategies including:<br> * Revisiting the U.S.P.<br> Rosser Reeves's classic unique selling proposition approach, updated for today's marketplace<br> * Positioning<br> Understanding how the mind works in the differentiating process<br> * Owning an Idea<br> Techniques to seize a differentiating idea, dramatize it, and make it your own<br> * Competition<br> How to use differentiating ideas against your competitors in the marketplace<br> Consumers today are faced with an explosion of choices. In this environment, distinctive product attributes are quickly copied by competitors, perceived by consumers to be minimal, or both. Still, those who fail to differentiate their product or service in the mind of the consumer won't stand a chance.<br> Differentiate or Die outlines the many ways you can achieve differentiation. It also warns how difficult it is to achieve differentiation by being creative, cheap, customer oriented, or quality driven things that your competitors can do as well.<br> Praise for Differentiate or Die<br> "Another great book by the king of positioning!"-John Schnatter, CEO, Papa John's International<br> "Differentiate or Die differentiates itself on the groaning marketing bookshelf with its lucid prose, its clear vision of the future marketplace . . . and its sensible solutions for surviving the frenzied competition we're sure to find there."-Dan Rather, CBS News<br> "What I like about Differentiate or Die is the book's emphasis on the power of logic, simplicity, and clarity-getting to the essence of a problem. In Silicon Valley, attributes like that can make the difference between having lunch and being lunch."-Scott McNealy, CEO, Sun Microsystems, Inc.<br> "Trout and Rivkin marvelously illustrate that differentiation is the cornerstone of successful marketing." -Philip Kotler, S.C. Johnson Distinguished Professor of International Marketing,<br> Kellogg Graduate School of Management, Northwestern University<br> "We've built our business by being first-and executing best. Jack Trout and Steve Rivkin are doing the same, delivering the timely, powerful insights that will drive tomorrow's marketing strategies. A must read for anyone looking to win in an unforgiving competitive marketplace."-Mike Ruettgers, CEO, EMC Corporation<br> "Dotcom executives must learn the lessons of Differentiate or Die. If they don't, I pity their investors."-Aaron Cohen, CEO, Concrete Media; Co-Founder, Bolt.com</p><p>There are no two ways about it with Jack Trout. Either you've got a product or service that you can say is different, or you don't have much at all. In today's global marketplace and at its lightning-fast rate of change, there's no point in inventing and presenting a product only to sit back and hope that consumers everywhere will discover its greatness. It's not simply about what you or your product can do, it's about what you do differently from everyone else. Coauthors Trout and Steve Rivkin say it all in their no-holds-barred title, <i>Differentiate or Die</i>.<p> A disciple of the marketing guru Rosser Reeves, who introduced the concept of the "unique selling proposition," Trout relays his vision of what can help you differentiate in blunt, tell-it-like-it-is prose. First he breaks the bad news that product quality, advertising creativity, price advantage, and breadth of product line are rarely successful ways to differentiate your business. Consumers expect the best quality, he says; they don't think it's a bonus. In the same vein, your competitor can slash prices just as quickly as you. After dismissing these common marketing techniques as futile, Trout concentrates on which differentiating ideas will set you apart from the pack: Being first (and staying there), owning a discernible attribute, having a heritage, becoming the preference of a particular consumer group, or even being the most recent arrival in a product arena are just some of these useful differentiates. Though the book's fast and quippy narrative style may leave some readers looking for more substance behind his adamant assertions, Trout's recommendations act as inspirational spurts of energy. A slim manual packed with punchy points, <i>Differentiate or Die</i> won't take you long to read but could make a lasting--you guessed it--difference to the success of your business. <i>--S.&nbsp;Ketchum</i></p>JACK TROUT is President of Trout &amp; Partners, one of the most prestigious marketing firms in the United States, with offices in 13 countries and a client list that includes AT&amp;T, IBM, Merrill Lynch, Sears, and other Fortune 500 companies.

Fichte, and the version of the <em>Wissenschaftslehre</em> or 'doctrine of science' that Fichte developed in Jena between 1794 and 1799. The book is intended to assist serious readers in their efforts to understand Fichte's philosophy within the context of its own era and to orient them in the ongoing scholarly debates concerning the character and significance of the <em>Wissenschaftslehre</em>. Breazeale focuses on explaining <em>what </em>Fichte was (and was not) trying to accomplish and precisely<em> how</em> he proposed to accomplish this, as well as upon the difficulties implicit in his project and his often novel strategies for overcoming them. To this end, the volume addresses a variety of specific themes, issues, and problems that will be familiar to any student of Fichte's early writings and which continue to be fiercely debated by his interpreters. These include: the relationship of the finite human self to the purely self-positing I, transcendental philosophy as a 'pragmatic history of the mind', Fichte's 'synthetic' method of philosophizing, the standpoint of life vs. the standpoint of speculation, the extra-philosophical presuppositions and implications of the <em>Wissenschaftslehre</em>, the different senses of 'intellectual intuition' in Fichte's early writings, the controversial doctrine of the 'check' (<em>Anstoss</em>) upon the free actions of the I, the various theoretical and practical tasks of philosophy, the refutation of dogmatism and the 'choice' of a philosophical standpoint, the relationship of transcendental idealism to skepticism, the interests of reason, and the problematic 'primacy of the practical' in Fichte's thought.<br></p><p><br>Daniel Breazeale, <em>University of Kentucky</em><br><br>Daniel Breazeale was born in Houston, Texas in 1945. After attending Austin College, he earned his PhD in philosophy from Yale University in 1971. Since then he has been a Professor of Philosophy at the University of Kentucky, where is also Distinguished Professor of Arts and Sciences. Breazeale has been a frequent recipient of research grants and fellowships from such sources as the National Endowment for Humanities and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation. He is a co-founder of the North American Fichte Society and the author of many essays on Fichte, German idealism, and Nietzsche. He is also the translator of numerous volumes of Fichte's writings and the co-editor of a dozen volumes of collected essays on his philosophy.<br><br>"<em>Thinking Through the Wissenschaftslehre</em> is an outstanding collection of fourteen of Daniel Breazeale's previously published essays. Each essay has been substantially revised for the volume. The chapters are self-standing, but themes overlap in helpful ways... [The book ] encapsulates Breazeale's decades of careful interpretative work. The book is a major contribution to Fichte studies and to the study of post-Kantian German philosophy more broadly. It is highly recommended for both scholars and students of Fichte." -- Michael Nance, <em>Philosophy in Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The interpretation of early music</h2><p><p><strong>Since it was first published in 1963, Robert Donington's classic text has become the standard of reference for all would-be performers , students, and amateurs of baroque music.</strong></p><p>Organized for the greatest clarity, the study consists of four main "books," respectively entitled Style, The Notes, The Expression, and The Instruments.

In <i>Hocus Pocus</i> (1990), a freewheeling prison memoir&nbsp;by a Vietnam vet and disgraced academic, Vonnegut brings his&nbsp;indelible voice to a range of still-burning issues&#x2014;free speech,&nbsp;racism, environmental calamity, deindustrialization, and globalization. <i>Timequake</i> (1997), the author&#x2019;s last completed novel,&nbsp;is part science fiction yarn (starring perennial protagonist&nbsp;Kilgore trout), part diary of the mid-1990s (starring the&nbsp;author himself). the result is a perfect fusion of Vonnegut&#x2019;s two&nbsp;signature genres, the satirical fantasy and the personal essay, and&nbsp;a literary magician&#x2019;s fond farewell to his readers and his craft. Rounded out with a selection of short nonfiction&nbsp;pieces intimately related to these three works, this&nbsp;volume presents the final word from the artist who the&nbsp;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, reviewing <i>Timequake</i>, called an&nbsp;&#x201c;old warrior who will not accept the dehumanizing of&nbsp;politics, the blunting of conscience, and the glibness of&nbsp;the late-twentieth-century Western world.&#x201d;<br><b><br>LIBRARY OF AMERICA</b> is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation&#x2019;s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America&#x2019;s best and most significant writing.

This is the first book to explicitly compare extreme rightist organizations, ideas, and actions in different national settings in Latin America. Hardly an undifferentiated whole, the right in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile has changed over time and has contained moderate and extreme factions; the book's title, <i>Las Derechas</i>, emphasizes this diversity. The author focuses on extreme right-wing movements, showing how their class and gender composition, motives, programs, and activities varied over time and between countries. To demonstrate the variety of thought and fluidity of positions within the far right, the author brings to life the many voices it contained: its highbrow and lowbrow figures, its male and female exponents, and its mass-circulation periodicals and more erudite literature. The depiction of rallies, social welfare projects, and brutal clashes with opponents also reveals the flavor of the radical right and the rich texture of its history. Although extreme right-wing movements defined themselves as masculine, some nevertheless recruited women; this is only one of the many contradictions between their ideology and actions. Concentrating on domestic roots, the study shows how radical rightists incorporated local concerns, not simply European dogma, into their agendas. It explores their relations with the military, Catholic Church, government, labor, and other groups throughout the political spectrum. The ties of radical rightists to moderate rightists are of particular interest, for the ideological and tactical differences between the two factions tended to diminish during periods of crisis. The book concludes with an epilogue that traces radical rightist movements up to the present, demonstrating the importance of the analysis for understanding current conditions as well as the past.</p><p>&#x201c;The deepest, most nuanced history of the complex tapestry that, superficially, is called the South American right. . . .

Yet also woven into the historical landscapeof this small county nestled within the Shenandoah Valley is an unusual collection of historic homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fascinating architectural exploration, John C. Allen, Jr. details his expansive seven-year survey of Jefferson County&#x2019;s historic residences.&nbsp;By focusing on dwellings built from the mid-eighteenth century to the arrival of the railroad and canal in 1835, Allen unfolds the unique story of this area&#x2019;s early building traditions and architectural innovations. The 250 buildings included in this work&#x2014;from the plantation homes of the Washington family to the log houses of yeomen farmers&#x2014;reveal the unique development of this region, as Allen categorizes structures and establishes patterns of construction, plan, and style.<br>Allen&#x2019;s refreshing perspective illuminates the vibrant vernacular architecture of Jefferson County, connecting the housing of this area to the rich history of the Shenandoah Valley. Varying features of house siting, plan types, construction techniques, building materials, outbuildings, and exterior and interior detailing illustrate the blending of German, Scots-Irish, English, and African cultures into a distinct, regional style.&nbsp;Adorned with over seven hundred stylish photographs by Walter Smalling and elegant drawings, floor plans, and maps by Andrew Lewis, <i>Uncommon Vernacular </i>explores and preserves this historic area&#x2019;s rich architectural heritage.<p></p></p><p>"Uncommon Vernacular opens for the casual reader and scholar alike a rich though largely underappreciated vein of America's architectural heritage.

D. Bernal's monumental work Science in History is the first full-scale attempt to analyze the relationship between science and society throughout history, from the perfection of the first flint hand ax to the construction of the hydrogen bomb. This remarkable study illustrates the impetus given to and the limitations placed upon discovery and invention by pastoral, agricultural, feudal, capitalist, and socialist systems, and conversely the ways in which science has altered economic, social, and political beliefs and practices.</p><p>This second volume focuses on the period of development and the establishment of modern science. It begins with work of the Renaissance and continues with a discussion of the stimulus given to scientific develpment by emerging seventeenth-century capitalism. A final section takes up the industrial revolution and the manner in which science and technology transformed the whole nature of human society.</p></p><p>" This stupendous work... is a magnificent synoptic view of the rise of science and its impact on society." -- The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>&amp; quot; This stupendous work... is a magnificent synoptic view of the rise of science and its impact on society.&amp; quot; -- The Times Literary Supplement<br><br>"This stupendous work... is a magnificent synoptic view of the rise of science and its impact on society."-- "The Times Literary Supplement"</p><h2>A Beginner&#39;s Guide to Coding</h2><p><p>Ever wondered how to make a computer follow instructions?

Readers will learn how to get started in Scratch, an easy to use web-based coding platform which is also available as an app (Scratch Jr.) for tablets. Scratch's building-block style of coding is pretty straightforward and readers can quickly pick up the basics, creating two fun games along the way. The book then moves on to Python, a text-based coding system with a very specific syntax. Readers will learn to move a turtle around the screen and program an AI game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Python will likely feel less intuitive, but the author reminds coders that mistakes are unavoidable and okay. Python is so complex, it's hard to adequately describe in less than 20 pages, a complaint which will ring true for many beginners' coding workbooks. The spiral-bound hardcover edition will inevitably breakdown in the hands of eager young coders, which could limit its lifespan in a library setting. That being said, with coding integrated into most schools and lots of public libraries, there is certainly an interest in materials like this.

Armstrong has often dealt with cops. For a single two-year span, as chief counsel to the Knapp Commission, he was charged with investigating them. Based on Armstrong's vivid recollections of this watershed moment in law enforcement accountability&#x2015;prompted by the <i>New York Times</i>'s report on whistleblower cop Frank Serpico&#x2015;<i>They Wished They Were Honest</i> recreates the dramatic struggles and significance of the Commission and explores the factors that led to its success and the restoration of the NYPD's public image.<br><br>Serpico's charges against the NYPD encouraged Mayor John Lindsay to appoint prominent attorney Whitman Knapp to chair a Citizen's Commission on police graft. Overcoming a number of organizational, budgetary, and political hurdles, Chief Counsel Armstrong cobbled together an investigative group of a half-dozen lawyers and a dozen agents. Just when funding was about to run out, the "blue wall of silence" collapsed. A flamboyant "Madame," a corrupt lawyer, and a weasely informant led to a "super thief" cop, who was trapped and "turned" by the Commission. This led to sensational and revelatory hearings, which publicly refuted the notion that departmental corruption was limited to only a "few rotten apples."<br><br>In the course of his narrative, Armstrong illuminates police investigative strategy; governmental and departmental political maneuvering; ethical and philosophical issues in law enforcement; the efficacy (or lack thereof) of the police's anticorruption efforts; the effectiveness of the training of police officers; the psychological and emotional pressures that lead to corruption; and the effects of police criminality on individuals and society. He concludes with the effects, in today's world, of Knapp and succeeding investigations into police corruption and the value of permanent outside monitoring bodies, such as the special prosecutor's office, formed in response to the Commission's recommendation, as well as the current monitoring commission, of which Armstrong is chairman.</p><p><p>An inside account of the Frank Serpico-inspired investigation into police criminality and its official cover up in late-1960s New York.</p>Michael F.

Interdisciplinary in scope and application, the book draws on linguistic, anthropological, and psychological currents to emphasize the importance of narrative and metaphor which influence thought and behavior both in the therapeutic setting and in the lives of people.</p><p>Drawing on linguistic, anthropological, and psychological currents the author emphasizes the importance of the narrative/metaphor in the therapeutic setting.

It provides an original examination of the Renaissance across the whole of the continent. <p>Peter Burke begins by examining the conditions in which innovation took place in cultural centers such as Florence, Avignon, Flanders and Rome in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. But his emphasis falls on the late Renaissance, c.1530-1630, when the new cultural forms and ideas reached the Celtic, Scandinavian and Slav peripheries. He discusses the process of the active reception or creative imitation of classical and Italian models at the level of everyday life as well as that of art, literature and music, noting the importance of the reproduction of famous works of art by means of engravings and ceramics. He also examines the social and political structures which shaped local responses to the movement. The book concludes with an assessment of the effects of the Renaissance movement on later centuries, including its contribution to the "Europeanization" of Europe.</p><b>Peter Burke</b> is Professor of Cultural History at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Emmanuel College.</p><h2>Ganong&#39;s Review of Medical Physiology 25th Edition</h2><p>Ganongs Review of Medical Physiology</p><p>Kim E.

A Certified Nutrition Specialist, Dr. Lieberman is the best-selling author of <i>Mineral Miracle </i>and <i>The Real Vitamin and Mineral Book </i></p><p>Originally designed as a guide for people with diabetes, the glycemic index is an important new nutritional tool that now has wide-ranging uses. By indicating how quickly a given food triggers a rise in blood sugar, it enables everyone&#x2015;from diabetics, to individuals who want to lose weight, to people who simply want to remain healthy&#x2015;to choose the foods that can help them meet their dietary and health goals. This book is an easy-to-use guide to the glycemic index, or GI. Whether you have been relying on the GI for years or have just heard about this wonderful tool, you&#x2019;re sure to find it invaluable as you learn about the GI and use it to make smart food choices.</p> <p>The book begins by answering a number of frequently asked questions about the glycemic index. Here you&#x2019;ll get a crash course in carbohydrates, which is what the GI is all about; learn about the glycemic index itself; and discover the importance of the GI in preventing and managing a host of disorders, from diabetes to cancer to fatigue. If you&#x2019;ve ever wondered why people with diabetes are urged to avoid certain foods, or simply why some foods so often lead to feelings of lethargy, you&#x2019;re sure to enjoy this easy-to-read Q and A. This section also addresses some issues that often confuse people when they first glance at the glycemic index of different foods. Why are certain foods, like meat and fish, not ranked on the glycemic index? Does eating more of a food cause its GI number to increase? What is glycemic load, or GL? Since carrots have a high GI, does that mean that they&#x2019;re an unhealthy food? Perhaps most important, the Q and A tells you how to use the glycemic index to create a diet that not only is healthy but also includes the foods you love. The fact is that you don&#x2019;t have to give up your favorite foods&#x2015;not even if they rank high on the index. You just have to learn to integrate them wisely in your diet by balancing high-GI choices with low-GI foods.</p> <p>After the Q and A section, you&#x2019;ll find the heart of the book: The Glycemic Index Food Guide. This table presents an alphabetical listing of hundreds of common foods and beverages, including many combination and prepared foods, along with their glycemic index ranking and their glycemic load. If you&#x2019;ve already used other GI lists, you&#x2019;ll immediately see that this one is different. First, while many lists express portion size in grams, this one has converted grams to familiar ounce measurements. Second, while other lists force you to search endlessly for a particular food, this one places each food not only under its name, but also under logical categories. Say you&#x2019;re looking for udon noodles, for instance. Whether you search for it under &#x201c;Udon,&#x201d; &#x201c;Asian Foods,&#x201d; or just plain &#x201c;Pasta,&#x201d; you&#x2019;ll quickly find its GI. In fact, several ethnic categories have been created to make it easy to dine at your favorite restaurant. You&#x2019;ll also see that instead of confusing GI numbers, this guide clearly identifies the glycemic index of a food as being low, medium, or high, so that you immediately understand its effect on blood glucose levels. Meanwhile, intriguing questions and tips have been sprinkled throughout the guide, leading you to informative discussions and highlighting good food choices.</p> <p>Because there&#x2019;s so much to learn about the glycemic index, and because more information is always becoming available, the book ends with a list of helpful websites. These sites provide more detailed information about topics of interest, and in many cases offer continuously updated databases of foods. Check them out, and you&#x2019;re sure to learn even more about this fascinating subject, as well as gleaning practical tips and suggestions for meeting your dietary goals.</p> <p>Whether you are interested in controlling your glucose levels to manage a specific health problem, you&#x2019;re trying to boost your energy levels, you wish to achieve a healthier weight, or you simply want to enhance your overall well-being, this guide was designed to help you every step of the way.

He was the son-in-law who had severely beaten their daughter Joanna a few months ago. Unfortunately, it appears that someone very close to the household is the murderer, though no one is about to confess to it.<br>Leave it to that canny police duo of Inspector Lloyd and Detective Sergeant Judy Hill to wander through a maze of self-confessed killers, myraid motives, and their own frustrating partnerships, to find a murderer with a message....</p><p>Jill McGown was born in Campbeltown, on the peninsula of Kintyre, in Argyll, but moved to Corby, Northamptonshire, with her family when she was ten, where she lived until her death in 2007. Coincidentally, at Corby Grammar School in the early sixties, her Latin teacher was Colin Dexter, long before Inspector Morse was policing Oxford. Jill is best known for her mystery series featuring Chief Inspector Lloyd and Sergeant Judy Hill, the first of which, A Perfect Match, was published in 1983. Murder at the Old Vicarage, originally published as Redemption, is the second Lloyd and Hill book of the thirteen novels in the series. She adopted the classic traditions of the genre, but brought a modern twist through her characters and situations, and many of her peers believe her work deserves to be better known.This finely crafted whodunit pays homage to Agatha Christie. But what differentiates McGown's work from the grande dame's classic tale bearing almost the same title is the interesting relationship she establishes between her two protagonists, Acting Chief Inspector Lloyd, known only by his surname, and Det. Sgt. Judy Hill. The duo, who debuted in A Perfect Match , work together and are lovers who have a problem: she is married and Lloyd wants to change the status quo. It's Christmas and they are assigned to investigate a murder in the English village of Byford at the home of vicar George Wheeler. His wife, Marian, has discovered the body of Graham Elstow, the estranged husband of their daughter, Joanna, after returning from the midnight service. To escape Elstow's physical abuse, Joanna has been living with her parents. Seeking a reconciliation, Elstow had visited her earlier in the day, and she is the last person to have seen him alive. Though it appears to be an open-and-shut case, numerous undercurrents bear investigation, including the vicar's sexual attraction to one of his parishioners.

It deals with, amongst others, the following areas:</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>the idea of nature&nbsp;</li> <li>the 'nature' of geography&nbsp;</li> <li>de-naturalization and re-naturalization</li> <li>after-nature.</li></ul> <p></p> <p>As everything from global warming to GM foods becomes headline news, the use and abuse of nature is on the agenda as never before.

Charged under an obscure blasphemy law in a small New Jersey town in 1919, Vijay Sahni is challenged by a skeptical judge to defend his belief that the certainty of mathematics can be extended to all human knowledge--including religion. Together, the two men discover the power--and the fallibility--of what has long been considered the pinnacle of human certainty, Euclidean geometry.</p><p> As grandfather and grandson struggle with the question of whether there can ever be absolute certainty in mathematics or life, they are forced to reconsider their fundamental beliefs and choices. Their stories hinge on their explorations of parallel developments in the study of geometry and infinity--and the mathematics throughout is as rigorous and fascinating as the narrative and characters are compelling and complex.

When, in the fifteenth century, they knocked at the gates of western Europe in the guise of pilgrims, they aroused intense curiosity as well as suspicion, and theories proliferated about their provenance. They remain a people whose culture and customs are beset with misunderstanding. This book describes their history. The story opens with an investigation into Gypsy origins, using the evidence of language and culture to identify their Indian ancestry. The author then traces the Gypsy migration through the Middle East, Europe and the world. They became renowned for their metal-working, music, fortune-telling, healing and horse-dealing. But right from the start they outraged latent prejudices in the settled populations they moved among. Governments sought to bring them to heel and they were harassed, outlawed, hunted down and banished. In what is now Rumania they were enslaved from the fourteenth century until the mid-nineteenth century; in 1725 the Prussians made the Gypsies into legal vermin and decreed that they could be hanged without trial; in Spain, in 1749 all Gypsies were rounded up, to be set to forced labour; in Switzerland, from 1926 to 1973, a respectable children&#39;s charity practised institutionalized abduction. Persecution reached its apogee when the Nazis embarked on outright genocide: in this forgotten holocaust perhaps half a million Gypsies lost their lives. The ethnic tensions in today&#39;s Europe mean that the pattern of antagonism continues. And yet this is in many ways a story of achievement. For the Gypsies managed, with no literate tradition, no state and no national identity, to preserve a distinctive heritage over centuries of vicissitude. How and why they did so are the twin themes of this book.</p><p>Since their unexplained appearance in Europe over nine centuries ago, the gypsies have refused to fall in with conventional settled life. They remain a people whose culture and customs are beset with misunderstanding, and who cling to their distinct identity in the teeth of persistent rejection and pressure to conform. This book describes their history.<br> <p>The book opens with an investigation of gypsy origins in India. The author then traces the gypsy migration from the early Middle Ages to the present, through the Middle East, Europe and the world. Throughout their known history they have been renowned for their music, metal working, fortune-telling, healing and horse-dealing; but from the outset they outraged the prejudices of the populations they encountered: they were enslaved, harrassed, outlawed and hunted. Yet against all the odds the gypsies have survived, preserving a distinctive heritage and culture that transcends national boundaries. How they did so is the compelling theme of this book.<br> </p> <p>This new paperback edition has been revised to take account of recent research and of the political changes in Eastern Europe, which have sadly been followed by a resurgence of Gypsy persecution in a number of countries.</p><b>Sir Angus Fraser</b> died on May 27, 2001, aged 73.

Eliot</h2><p>When Denis Donoghue left Warrenpoint and went to Dublin in September 1946, he entered University College as a student of Latin and English. A few months later he also started as a student of lieder at the Royal Irish Academy of Music. These studies have informed his reading of English, Irish, and American literature.<p>Now in this volume, one of our most distinguished readers of modern literature offers his most personal book of literary criticism. Donoghue's Words Alone is an intellectual memoir, a lucid and illuminating account of his engagement with the works of T. S. Eliot -- from initial undergraduate encounters with "The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock" to later submission to Eliot's entire writings. "The pleasure of Eliot's words persists", Donoghue says, "only because in good faith it can't be denied".</p><p>Submission to Eliot, in Donoghue's case, involves the ear as much as it does the mind. He is a reader who listens attentively and a writer whose own music in these pages commands attention. Whether he is writing about Eliot's poetry or confronting the (often contentious) prose, Donoghue eloquently demonstrates what it means to read and to hear a master of language.</p></p><p>"Donoghue has found a new way of combining autobiography and criticism, and the justification for the experiment is the maturity -- the wisdom -- of his commentary on Eliot's poetry. Resolutely a Christian himself, he does something slightly unusual and comments on the poems with a Christian intimacy, but his work is always illuminated by a decisiveness and strength that will make it valuable to all intelligent readers." -- Frank Kermode <p>"A probing and wide-ranging examination of Eliot's poetry that treats the work with respectful seriousness." -- New York Times Book Review </p> <p>"Superb." -- Steven Moore, Washington Post Book World </p> <p>A New York Times Book Review Notable Book</p>Denis Donoghue is University Professor and Henry James Professor of English and American Letters at New York University.

Oakley The Aeneid is Virgil&#39;s Masterpiece. His epic poem recounts the story of Rome&#39;s legendary origins from the ashes of Troy and proclaims her destiny of world dominion. This optimistic vision is accompanied by an undertow of sadness at the price that must be paid in human suffering to secure Rome&#39;s future greatness. The tension between the public voice of celebration and the tragic private voice is given full expression both in the doomed love of Dido and Aeneas, and in the fateful clash between the Trojan leader and the Italian hero, Turnus. Hailed by T.S. Eliot as &#39;the classic of all Europe&#39;, Virgil&#39;s Aeneid has enjoyed a unique and enduring influence on European literature, art and politics for the past two thousand years.</p><p>This book is the equal of its great Homeric predecessors, The Iliad and The Odyssey, in dramatic and narrative power, and it surpasses them in the intense sympathy which makes events such as the passion and destruction of Dido and the fall of Turnus among the most memorable in literature.VIRGIL (70 -19 B.C), regarded as the greatest Roman poet, was born in a small village near Mantua in Northern Italy and attended school at Cremona, Milan, and Rome, where he studied mathematics, medicine, and rhetoric. He devoted his life, from 30 to 19 B.C., to the composition of <i>The Aeneid</i>, the national epic of Rome.</p><h2>The Satires of Persius (BCPaperbacks)</h2><p><p>This volume, published in 1968, was the first critical study of Persius in English. This new edition offers a close reading within the framework of criticism which led classics in the 1960s. Cynthia Dessen emphasizes the distinction between persona and poet and argues that Persius's satires, far from being "difficult" are unified and comprehensible through their controlling metaphors, their dominant imagery and word-repetition.</p></p><p>Cynthia Dessen is a member of the Department of English at the University of N. Carolina, Chapel Hill.</p><h2>The Settling of North America: The Atlas of the Great Migrations into North America from the Ice Age to the Present</h2><p>Uses maps to show the arrival of a wide range of ethnic groups in America, from the Ice Age to the present</p><p>This historical atlas focuses on the U.S. and Canada. Arrangement is chronological, with seven sections covering prehistoric times to 1950^-55; the final section looks at aspects of the present. An illustrated introduction prefaces each of the first seven sections; a time line follows, with parallel columns for North America, Central and South America, and the rest of the world. Then double-page spreads present thematic maps (several per spread), text, and illustrations.<p>Representative of coverage are the two pages titled "Mid Europe to Mid West: Immigration from West Central Europe, 1860^-1920." About 25 percent of the space is devoted to text. One map shows population growth and migration in West Central Europe; it reflects more internal than external mobility. Another map illustrates where various ethnic groups lived in Milwaukee. Color gradations are used (not always successfully) to distinguish between settlement at three periods. A third map shows German place-names in the Midwest. Captioned illustrations depict Castle Garden and a Turnverein ball program.</p><p>Pages are attractive and replete with information. Maps are clear and easy to read, use of color is generous, and map keys understandable. A reader can open at random and find something interesting and informative. Sample maps include migrant neighborhoods in 1920 Chicago, Native American trade networks, Caribbean migration, the powwow circuit, and Minorcan, Italian, and Greek immigration to Florida. Contributors are subject specialists and graduate students; the editor is a research fellow at the Newberry Library. The lengthy bibliography references a variety of articles, reports, books, and atlases. Access is through a detailed table of contents and place and name indexes.</p><p>Libraries with interests in immigration, cultural diversity, genealogy, geography, and/or social history should consider purchase to complement their atlas collection. The physical attractiveness and broad intellectual sweep of <i>The Settling of North America</i> commend it for educational settings. <i></i></p>More than 100 color maps chart the movements of peoples in and around North America over a three thousand year period: these form the heart of a fine visual history for adults which is authenticated by a team of historians and which presents fine overviews of all ethnic group experiences. Highly recommended as a basic visual history for those who want in-depth coverage of timeline events. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>William and Henry James: Selected Letters</h2><p><p>William and Henry James are well known for their master works of psychology and fiction respectively, but the celebrated brothers amassed an impressive collection of letters to one another as well. Through their copious correspondence, readers are privy to the private thoughts of these intellectual heavyweights. Sure, their letters expound on philosophical, political, social, and cultural subjects with imagination and wit, but more often they focus on the quotidian: health, news of friends and family, mutual praise, advice, complaints, and good-natured ribbing. What makes these 216 epistles remarkable is the quality of writing and the keen observations made by the brothers James during their wide and frequent travels across America and Europe. The letters contained in <i>William and Henry James: Selected Letters</i> span more than 50 years and are infused with the history and events of their era. This volume illuminates each man's distinct personality and reveals the relationship the two crafted out of equal parts of criticism and support.</p></p><p>This collection of 216 letters offers an accessible, single-volume distillation of the exchange between celebrated brothers William and Henry James. Spanning more than fifty years, their correspondence presents a lively account of the persons, places, and events that affected the Euro-American world from 1861 until the death of William James in August 1910. An engaging introduction by John J.

More than just a work of suspense and mystery, it is a work of ideas--a discussion of the contrasts between hedonistic doctrines and a system of education and values.</p><p>Ann Radcliffe&#x2019;s <b>Romance of the Forest</b>, first published in 1791, is the epitome of the Gothic novel: a beautiful, orphaned heiress, a dashing hero, a dissolute, aristocratic villain and a ruined abbey deep in a great forest are combined by the author in a tale of suspense where danger lurks behind every secret trap-door. Reprinted four times between 1791 and 1795 and satirised as representative of the Gothic genre by Jane Austen in <b>Northanger Abbey</b>, Radcliffe&#x2019;s tense masterpiece, in which the heroine is afraid even to look in the mirror for fear of what she might see behind her, established her reputation as a writer and her brilliant descriptions of both characters and scenes serve to create the perfect atmosphere for a novel packed with emotional intensity.Chloe Chard, Lecturer in English, University of Sheffield.</p><h2>Learn Ukrainian - Quick / Easy / Efficient: 2000 Key Vocabularies</h2><p><p><b>A curated Ukrainian word frequency list</b></p>Are you looking for unconventional ways to speed up the process of learning Ukrainian?

The recent technological revolutions in video recording, editing, and distribution are more akin to the development of movable type than any other such revolution in the last five hundred years. And yet we are not popularly cognizant of or conversant with visual storytelling's grammar, the coded messages of its style, and the practical components of its production. We are largely, in a word, illiterate.<br> But this is not a gloomy diagnosis of the collapse of civilization; rather, it is a celebration of the progress we've made and an exhortation and a plan to seize the potential we're poised to enjoy. The rules that define effective visual storytelling&#x2015;much like the rules that define written language&#x2015;do in fact exist, and Stephen Apkon has long experience in deploying them, teaching them, and witnessing their power in the classroom and beyond. In <i>The Age of the Image</i>, drawing on the history of literacy&#x2015;from scroll to codex, scribes to printing presses, SMS to social media&#x2015;on the science of how various forms of storytelling work on the human brain, and on the practical value of literacy in real-world situations, Apkon convincingly argues that now is the time to transform the way we teach, create, and communicate so that we can all step forward together into a rich and stimulating future.</p></p><p><p><b>Stephen Apkon</b> is the Founder and Executive Director of The Jacob Burns Film Center, a non-profit film and education organization located in Pleasantville, N.Y.

Some of the nation&#x2019;s more exuberant players were in the habit of videotaping themselves jamming on the fake guitars and uploading this footage to YouTube, the massive file-sharing site that had been launched only a year earlier. <br>Those who were paying attention noticed a commonality in the really popular clips: they emphasized ridiculous quasi&#x2013;rock star poses, and the cameras zoomed in on the player&#x2019;s face while ignoring the game unfolding on the screen. <br>This emerging trope seemed ripe for parody. Wong enlisted a few friends; borrowed a motorcycle, donned a black leather jacket, a red sequined shirt, and medieval chains; and preened like a vain thug. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s up, Internet?&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;My name&#x2019;s Freddie and I&#x2019;ve come from a long hard day of rocking faces and doing jumps with my sweet bike here to come and <i>rock you</i>.&#x201d; A flunky removes the jacket from Wong&#x2019;s shoulders like an obedient valet. Wong sneers that the chains on his chest are there to keep his soul tied down; otherwise, it would fly off and &#x201c;impregnate women.&#x201d; <br>Then comes an utterly ridiculous set piece in which Wong&#x2019;s exaggerated licks on the fake guitar are kept in time with the scoring of the game, run as a split screen. Wong does a relatively average job on the scoring, but he acts throughout as though he were supremely pleased with himself. And then, in an unexpected coup de gr�ce, he smashes the plastic guitar, punk-style, with a triumphant &#x201c;Yes!&#x201d; <br>The performance was designed to be ludicrous&#x2014;which it was&#x2014;but the larger purpose was to engage the Internet&#x2019;s boisterous hive of largely anonymous users who watch, criticize, and share amateur videos. It didn&#x2019;t matter that the strap of the guitar was accidentally hanging on Freddie the wrong way, or that the lighting was crude. The video was smart and it was literate and it shared a set of in-gestures with the audience. Within a few weeks, it received more than a million hits on YouTube, as friends e-mailed it through the exponential matrix of social connections. Wong has since duplicated this success many times over. <br>&#x201c;Gamer Commute,&#x201d; for example, which received more than nine million views within two months, begins with a shot of Wong waking up in an ordinary bedroom and making a choice of clothes from an electronic menu&#x2014;glasses, gray T-shirt, flip-flops, cargo shorts. Three guns fly toward him and embed themselves in his body with a metallic click. He then gets into his Toyota, and after taking it up to the speed limit on an ordinary Los Angeles street, he climbs on top of the roof of the moving car and fires a pistol in the air. All of this was achieved with green screens and special effects. The video ends with Wong coming into his ordinary-looking office cubicle and sitting down with a bored expression, resigned to the mundane workday. The video builds upon a foundation of cultural knowledge, and then leaves an unstated moral conclusion: that the gaming world contains far too many thrills and blood spatters to be sustainable in the dreary existence of working life. <br>One wonders how many of the nine million clicks &#x201c;Gamer Commute&#x201d; received were made from cubicles such as the one Wong occupies at the video&#x2019;s end. <br>Freddie Wong&#x2019;s success on YouTube was anything but a random accident. He did not make a video and just throw it against the wall of the Internet to see if it would stick. In fact, his career has been built not so much on creative randomness as on deliberate calculation, in much the same way Jack Kerouac wrote <i>On the Road</i> not as a freewheeling, spontaneous howl of beatnik joy, but rather as a shrewd attempt to write a bestseller that would embody the rambling spirit of the late 1950s. Like Kerouac, Wong found cultural receptivity, and he has done more to uncrack the nebulous market &#x201c;science&#x201d; behind effective amateur filmmaking than just about anybody working today. <br>This inquiry into the base code of successful videos started when Wong was still an undergraduate at USC. He wrote a thesis called the &#x201c;10^6 Project,&#x201d; its name implying a force with exponential power. &#x201c;Why do videos go viral?&#x201d; he asked. &#x201c;What kind of content goes viral? And what are the strategies and techniques utilized to promote them?&#x201d; Wong and his classmate and partner Brandon Laatsch started looking closer at the videos that had gone viral, and at the core factors in their doing so. <br>&#x201c;They repeat a formula,&#x201d; Wong said. &#x201c;The success of videos was seen as this random force, but when you have an enormous body of people doing the same thing, that element of randomness disappears.&#x201d; <br>Herein lies a paradox: watching videos on the Web is usually a solitary experience, but Wong tapped into a social gold mine. People who watch homemade videos love to pass them on to their friends. It is a way to have a connection with others and even to claim a little credit for the creativity of the filmmaker, because it is you who first noticed and laughed at his brilliance; the humor accrues to the sharer. People take a social risk when they e-mail a link to a Web video to friends, or call them over to the laptop. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re putting yourself out there,&#x201d; says Wong. So it had better be amusing. <br>The factor he is aiming for, then, is what, for newspapers, used to be called the &#x201c;Hey, Martha&#x201d; factor: the quirky, indescribable story that would persuade a reader to toss the Metro section over to his wife and say, &#x201c;Hey, Martha, you have to read this.&#x201d; Enjoying the story together and then talking about it, even arguing about it, become as much a part of the experience as the viewing. So in Wong&#x2019;s case, the maker&#x2019;s imperative is to provoke a specific response in the viewer, namely, &#x201c;What will make me want to show this to other people?&#x201d; <br>This medium of exchange is critical in an era when our choices of what to watch are so easily driven by the recommendations of our friends, which usually come in the form not of spoken plaudits but of a forwarded e-mail. This is the way we share literacy in this century. <br>Henry Jenkins, a professor of communication at the University of Southern California, writes about this in a book called <i>Spreadable Media: Creating Meaning and Value in a Networked Culture</i>, written with Sam Ford and Joshua Green. Jenkins says the act of forwarding a video link both gives an inherent sense of added value to the product and instantaneously creates a mini-community. <br>&#x201c;Rather than seeing circulation as the empty exchange of information stripped of context and meaning, we see these acts of circulation as constituting bids for meaning and value,&#x201d; Jenkins writes with his coauthors. &#x201c;We feel that it very much matters who sends the message, who receives it, and most importantly, what messages get sent.&#x201d; <br>In short, context matters in these mini-communities. Freddie Wong, too, noticed a contextual factor at work in videos that were truly successful in eliciting page clicks. The sound and the dialogue needed to be only basically intelligible, as they were likely to be competing with other sounds. And for that reason, sound element didn&#x2019;t matter nearly as much as the visual components. The filmmaker&#x2019;s credo that &#x201c;plot matters&#x201d; holds true more than ever, but plot must be expressed in a way that can be seen. It lends itself to a more physical type of acting&#x2014;almost a mimetic method that dates to the silent era of movies at the turn of the twentieth century. <br>&#x201c;You have to assume that these videos are being played on laptops, tablets and cell phones with tiny speakers&#x201d; says Wong. &#x201c;And that there&#x2019;s going to be noise and other distractions in the room. And so you have to make it visually interesting in order to cut through the static noise and draw the proper attention to the central message of the video.&#x201d; <br>The new era of the digital peep show has something else in common with the brief films of the silent era. Like those early films, today&#x2019;s videos are meant to be international in their appeal. The early film studios in Patterson, New Jersey, were cranking out three-minute reels that could be understood in Paris and Buenos Aires as well as in New York. Short films with limited dialogue are more easily appreciated, and therefore more likely to be watched and shared in nations where English is not widely spoken. Visuals are not hampered by the constraints of tongue; they work in most any culture&#x2014;which is why Freddie Wong has a following in Croatia. <br>Thus stripped of most traditional linguistic elements, the short film has to move fast, but it must strive not to confuse the viewer with too many moving objects or jarring cuts. The format of a short online video is subject to a concept called &#x201c;dropoff,&#x201d; in which the viewer simply gets bored and stops watching. Conventional Hollywood movies longer than ninety minutes and shown to a captive paying audience in a theater have the luxury of padding out the material or slowing down the story to draw out the narrative experience. Video shorts do not enjoy that luxury; viewers can &#x201c;walk out&#x201d; with a simple click. <br>This isn&#x2019;t to say that filmmakers succeed when they aim for the lowest common denominator. The video has to demonstrate a balance between accessibility and sophistication. <br>The Harvard scholar Marjorie Garber, in her landmark book <i>The Use and Abuse of Literature</i>, lays out the tricky question of what distinguishes a piece of literary writing from the merely everyday. Garber postulates that a text ought to draw upon some of the foundational works that came before it, if even in shadow&#x2014;the myth of the flawed hero, a Homeric sea journey, a pair of doomed lovers. The work also ought to have a quality of openness to it, a certain ambiguity that leaves the author&#x2019;s intentions at least partly in the dark, so that the &#x201c;meaning&#x201d; of the text might be pleasingly unclear and the conclusion left for the reader to draw from his own experiences. <br>This is a hard thing to get right, and Wong&#x2019;s videos meet both standards of Garber&#x2019;s literacy test. He draws upon a body of work that is familiar to most of his viewers: the world of video games, in which certain tropes (the car chase, the first-person shooter, and the explosions of colorful blood in simulated combat) are recognizable and even shopworn to the audience. Wong&#x2019;s videos take these standards and apply them to ridiculous scenarios so that the &#x201c;fish out of water&#x201d; quality might itself be the locus for the joke, and for the narrative pleasure of the audience, who is acquainted with the in-references. <br>Wong is not alone in tapping old literary veins with new visual technology. Just across town from him live two transplanted New Yorkers, brothers Benny and Rafi Fine, who have produced several narrative Web series and their own sort of talk-show format called <i>Kids Watch Viral Videos</i> (which evokes memories of Art Linkletter&#x2019;s 1960s television program <i>Kids Say the Darndest Things</i>). The Fine brothers&#x2019; videos have garnered millions of hits, and Benny and Rafi have become celebrities in the Web video world, complete with squealing fans. On a recent trip to London, they were spotted by a group of young teens who trailed them down the sidewalk until they had the courage to approach them and gush over their videos. While the Fine brothers are not exactly the Beatles, their videos have recognition and panache. And they are hard at work creating new pieces while meeting with corporations that want to hire them to create videos that feature the companies&#x2019; products. <br>When a mysterious person who called herself &#x201c;wigoutgirl&#x201d; posted the video &#x201c;Bride Has Massive Hair Wig Out&#x201d; on the Internet, it spread like angry lice, reaching 2.8 million viewers in a few weeks. The home video, shot by an unseen bridesmaid, shows a freaked-out bride on her wedding day who has just received a bad haircut. She grows progressively more upset, then seizes a pair of scissors and begins cutting it all off&#x2014;a scenario that perhaps fed directly into every woman&#x2019;s worst nightmare. Most men laughed at the distaff drama of it, but the scene was compelling, and lent itself to multiple watchings and sharings. <br>Turns out, the video was not documentary footage but a scripted set of images filmed in a real hotel suite. The shampoo company Unilever had done it as a publicity stunt&#x2014;but a clever one. The footage has been viewed over twelve million times, essentially because it is a well-constructed piece of drama that transfixes the viewer with a story that almost everyone can relate to. <br>There is big money to be made in creating literate visual stories, even if they are somewhat silly. You don&#x2019;t need to be highbrow to be literate. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Among the more than three billion videos watched each day on sites such as YouTube, there is undoubtedly a lot of garbage. But in what medium is there not? Of all the paintings hanging on walls of museums around the world, there is a small subset that I&#x2019;d like to hang on my own walls. In every medium there is a wide range of content, and a difference in taste among consumers. We must never assume that an appeal to the masses represents illiteracy. In fact, it implies a high degree of literacy. And in the new century, that increasingly means visual media. <br>The language of the modern cinema is only about a century old, and it continues to develop. Some of its conventions will never change, yet it has suddenly become relevant not just to passive moviegoers, but also to ordinary citizens, who can now &#x201c;write&#x201d; in a way that was once reserved for the elite. <br>Freddie Wong&#x2019;s guitar stunt would have been impossible even seven years ago. There was no giant information commons of video files, no YouTube or Vimeo. His creations definitely would have gotten some laughs among his friends, but they would never have gotten such instant traction in the world at large. The proliferation of devices that allow us easily and proficiently to capture moving images, the introduction of inexpensive and accessible editing tools, and at the same time the emergence of distribution sites such as YouTube, which made its debut in 2005, have changed the game forever. <br>Today more than forty-eight hours of fresh video is uploaded to YouTube every minute, which translates to eight years of content added every day. To put that in perspective: each month, there is more video added to the site than the collective output of the three major television networks since their founding after World War II. There are more than eight hundred million unique visitors watching videos each month on YouTube, with more than 70 percent of this traffic coming from outside the United States. We are part of a global visual conversation. The medium of television itself is moving quickly away from the polished network-produced shows and into more renegade do-it-yourself programming, where the rules are being rewritten. <br>&#x201c;With more...</p><h2>Layer of Protection Analysis</h2><p>Layer of protection analysis (LOPA) is a recently developed, simplified method of risk assessment that provides the much-needed middle ground between a qualitative process hazard analysis and a traditional, expensive quantitative risk analysis. Beginning with an identified accident scenario, LOPA uses simplifying rules to evaluate initiating event frequency, independent layers of protection, and consequences to provide an order-of-magnitude estimate of risk. LOPA has also proven an excellent approach for determining the safety integrity level necessary for an instrumented safety system, an approach endorsed in instrument standards, such as ISA S84 and IEC 61511. Written by industry experts in LOPA, this pioneering book provides all the necessary information to undertake and complete a Layer of Protection Analysis during any stage in a processes&#39; life cycle. Loaded with tables, charts, and examples, this book is invaluable to technical experts involved with ensuring the safety of a process. Because of its simplified, quicker risk assessment approach, LOPA is destined to become a widely used technique.

The existential-phenomenological emphasis opens channels of conscious awareness that enable people in therapy and in everyday living to awaken to their own visions, hopes, and dreams. The internal shadows and fires of individual consciousness come to light in therapy and in dreams and invite self-resources and self-directions for change in self-growth and in significant relationships. An Existential Model is presented in detail as a guide to effective psychotherapy. With slight modification, the Model is also applicable to an understanding and interpretation of one's own dreams as well as the dreams of people who are in therapy. Through existential awareness and reflective thinking, the reader is encouraged to discover constructive challenges and paradoxes that connect dreams with waking life and lead to the discovery of creative possibilities for work and living. The existential approach to psychotherapy and dream interpretation is explicated through examples of phenomenological interviewing, use of description in lifting out horizons and core meanings, and analysis of core themes that intimately embrace the self. Existential philosophy recognizes mystery encompasses the unknown and unpredictable and asserts that regardless of past suffering and impoverishment, the potentials for health and well-being are within reach. The Existential Model offers a practical methodology and a set of guides for achieving these goals and finding a future that moves beyond the restraints and rejections that have resulted from choosing the wrong path for identity expression and selfhood. The person is the central catalyst for decision and action and retains control over her or his own destiny.</p><p>Dr.<b>Clark Moustakas</b> is former President of the Center for Humanistic Studies and is one of the pioneers in the development of humanistic psychology and play therapy.</p><h2>Disney Pixar: Monsters University: Play-a-Sound Book</h2><p>Engaging sound storybook encourages participation by the littlest readers!

Prior to 1988 it had escaped detection even though the entire forest was in plain view and was being visited by thousands upon thousands of people every year. The reason no one had discovered the forest was that the trees were relatively small and lived on the vertical cliffs of the Niagara Escarpment. <strong><em>The Last Stand</em></strong> reveals the complete account of the discovery of this ancient forest, of the miraculous properties of the trees forming this forest (eastern white cedar), and of what is was like for researchers to live, work and study within this forest. The unique story is told with text, with stunning colour photographs and through vivid first-hand accounts. This book will stand the test of time as a testament to science, imagination and discovery.</p></p><p>An ancient cedar forest exists on the Niagara Escarpment in a highly populated area.

She earned her JD from Hofstra University and her LLM from Temple University."What I do NOT like about the other textbooks is that they are more "red-eye" type telling about the ethical concern and not requiring critical thinking on the part of the student to determine what is "ethical and moral" in the legal context. For example, all of the other texts tend to show "employment-at-will" with the boss being able to fire the employee with or without cause as being unethical. However, in your text, you present both sides of the legal doctrine with the employer's side being presented also. This is something that the students have never even thought about. Because of the format of this Textbook, I am able to engage the students in a lot of critical thinking on subjects of legal and ethical interest to all of them. For instance, most students have never heard the other side to things like Affirmative Action. This causes the students to begin thinking not only in the classroom but in their current and future jobs. Because of this, my course in Business Ethics with your textbook is often rated one of the most interesting and most useful course students have taken in their college life. I also get calls often from former students that have run into an ethical/legal issue in their current work that we have covered. They want to refresh their knowledge of what they learned. Therefore, your current textbook is having an impact on students in real-life situations."<br><br>"I found the Instructor's Manual invaluable.

But her life is about to veer from the path trod by her mother and grandmother. When her ne&#x2019;er-do-well father learns that his family is the last of a long noble line, the d&#x2019;Urbervilles, he sends Tess on a journey to meet her supposed kin&#x2014;a journey that will see her victimized by lust, poverty, and hypocrisy. Shaped by an acute sense of social injustice and by a vision of human fate cosmic in scope, her story is a singular blending of harsh realism and poignant beauty. Thomas Hardy created in Tess not a standard Victorian heroine but a woman whose intense vitality shines against the bleak backdrop of a dying way of life.

The edition, containing both stories, features John Tenniel&#39;s original illustrations.</p><p>That Alice. When she's not traipsing after a rabbit into Wonderland, she's gallivanting off into the topsy-turvy world behind the drawing-room looking glass. In <i>Through the Looking Glass</i>, Lewis Carroll's masterful and zany sequel to <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i>, she makes more eccentric acquaintances, including Tweedledee and Tweedledum, the White Queen, and a somewhat grumpy Humpty Dumpty. Through a giant and elaborate chess game, Alice explores this odd country, where one must eat dry biscuits to quench thirst, and run like the wind to stay in one place. As in life, Alice must stay on her toes to learn the rules of this game. <i>Through the Looking Glass</i> immediately took its rightful place beside its partner on the shelf of eternal classics. And luckily for generations of enraptured children, Carroll was again able to persuade John Tenniel to create the fantastic woodblock engravings that have become so indelibly associated with the Alice stories. For almost 130 years, Alice's curious adventures have amused, perplexed, and delighted readers, young and old. This gorgeous, deluxe boxed set of both volumes contains engravings from Tenniel's original woodblocks that were discovered in a London bank in 1985, and reproduced for the first time here.

Comparing wives and warriors in the U.S. and Canada, it examines how the military in both countries constructs gender to exclude women from being respected as equals to men. Written by a wide range of scholars and military personnel, the book covers such contemporary issues as the opening of military academies to women, the opening of combat posts to women, the experience of being a wife in the two-person career of an officer-husband, sexual harassment, turnover of women in the armed services, and U.S. and Canadian policies allowing gays and lesbians to serve in the military. Part of an emerging feminist scholarship in military studies, this work also explores how gender has been constructed to maintain the status quo and women's narrowly defined roles as the dependent helpmates of men.</p></p><p><p>A fascinating study of women who serve the military as wives or as soldiers, sailors, and flyers, with emphasis on current issues, written by a wide range of scholars and military professionals.</p><p>LAURIE WEINSTEIN is Associate Professor of Anthropology at Western Connecticut State University.

George Lakoff analyzed recent political discussion to find that the family&#x2014;especially the ideal family&#x2014;is the most powerful metaphor in politics today. Revealing how family-based moral values determine views on diverse issues as crime, gun control, taxation, social programs, and the environment, George Lakoff looks at how conservatives and liberals link morality to politics through the concept of family and how these ideals diverge. Arguing that conservatives have exploited the connection between morality, the family, and politics, while liberals have failed to recognized it, Lakoff explains why conservative moral position has not been effectively challenged. A wake up call to political pundits on both the left and the right, this work redefines how Americans think and talk about politics.<br></p><p><strong>George Lakoff</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Science and Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley. He is the author or coauthor of numerous books.A study, part academic and part popular, of the differences in moral conceptual systems that underlie the conservative-liberal debate. If your baby cries at night, do you pick him up? The answer to that question, suggests cognitive scientist Lakoff (Univ. of Calif., Berkeley), is the single best indicator of liberal or conservative values. Driven by curiosity about how liberals and conservatives can ``seem to be talking about the same things and yet reach opposite conclusions'' and why conservatives ``like to talk about discipline and toughness, while liberals like to talk about need and help,'' Lakoff sets out to discover where the difference lies in the two moral visions. He finds it in models of the family and of family-based values: Conservatives favor the ``Strict Father'' model, while liberals conceive of the family as a ``Nurturant Parent.'' That difference, Lakoff argues, yields systems of logic so disparate that liberals and conservatives cannot even begin to understand their opponents' reasoning on issues like abortion, welfare, capital punishment, and gay rights. That much is, on the surface, reasonable enough. Lakoff's argument steers onto more controversial ground, however, when he suggests that ``conservatives have a deeper insight into their worldview than liberals have into theirs,'' inasmuch as conservatives talk constantly of family values whereas liberals shy from discussions of hearth-and-home morality. The ``new understanding of American politics'' that he proposes, not surprisingly, favors conservative values. Lakoff concludes with the observation that ``public political discourse is so impoverished at present that it cannot accommodate'' discussions of matters like family-based moralities- -unless, that is, liberals and conservatives begin to develop a ``meta-language'' that will enable them to speak of such things. That conservatives and liberals see the world differently comes as no news to most, but Lakoff's look into just why that should be so makes for interesting reading. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The primary focus is on managerial leadership as opposed to parliamentary leadership, leadership of social movements, or emergent leadership in informal groups. The book presents a broad survey of theory and, research on leadership in formal organizations. The topic of leadership effectiveness is of special interest. Again and again the discussion returns to the question of what makes a person an effective leader. </p> <p> The content of the book reflects a dual concern for theory and practice. I have attempted to satisfy two different audiences with somewhat incompatible preferences. Most academics prefer a book that provides a detailed explanation and critical evaluation of major theories, and a comprehensive review and evaluation of empirical research. They are more interested in how well the research is done and what additional research is needed than in the practical applications. Many academics are skeptical about the value of prescriptions and guidelines for practitioners and consider them premature in the absence of further research. In contrast, most practitioners want some immediate answers about what to do and how to do it in order to be more effective as leaders. They need to deal with the current challenges of their job and cannot wait for decades until the academics resolve their theoretical disputes and obtain definitive answers. Most practitioners are more interested in finding helpful remedies and prescriptions than in finding out how this knowledge was discovered. </p> <p> These different preferences are a major reason for the much-lamented gulf between scientists and practitioners in industrial-organizational psychology and related fields. I believe it is important for managers and administrators to understand the complexity of effective leadership, the source of our knowledge about leadership in organizations, and the limitations of this knowledge. Likewise, I believe it is important for academics to think more about how their theories and research can be used to improve the practice of management. Too much of our leadership research is designed only to examine narrow, esoteric questions that are of interest only to a few other social scientists who publish in the same journals. </p> <p> Academics will be pleased to find that major theories are explained and critiqued, empirical research on leadership is reviewed and summarized, and many references are provided to enable them to follow up with additional reading on topics of special interest. The field of leadership is still in a state of ferment, with many continuing controversies about conceptual and methodological issues. The book addresses these issues whenever feasible rather than merely presenting theories and summarizing findings without concern for the quality of research that lies behind the theories. However, the literature review was intended to be incisive, not comprehensive. Rather than detailing an endless series of theories and studies, the book focuses on the 20 percent of the literature that appeared to be most relevant and informative. The book reviews what we know about leadership effectiveness, and the current edition reflects significant progress in our understanding of leadership since the first edition was published in 1981. </p> <p> For practitioners, I attempted to convey a better appreciation of the complexity of managerial leadership, the importance of having theoretical knowledge about leadership, and the need to be flexible and pragmatic in applying this knowledge. The current edition has many guidelines and recommendations for improving managerial effectiveness, but the book is not a "practitioner's manual" of simple techniques and secret recipes that guarantee instant success. The purpose of the guidelines is to help the reader understand the practical implications of leadership theory and research, not to prescribe exactly how things must be done by a leader. Most of the guidelines are based on a limited amount of research, and they are not infallible. </p> <p> Since the last edition, the number of chapters was reduced from 19 to 15 by consolidating related topics into the same chapter, minimizing redundancy among chapters, and deleting some topics that are usually covered adequately in introductory survey courses. The changes made some of the chapters a little longer, but the book is now easier to use in a course with a 15-week format, as well as in shorter courses. This edition includes one new chapter, which was added to cover four important and related topics: ethical leadership, gender and leadership, cross-cultural leadership, and management of diversity. I have added learning objectives at the beginning of each chapter to provide a better overview of what I wanted to accomplish in the chapter. </p> <p> At the end of most chapters are short cases designed to help the reader gain a better understanding of the theories, concepts, and guidelines presented in the chapter. The cases describe events that occurred in real organizations, but some of the cases were modified to make them more useful for learning basic concepts and effective practices. The reader is asked to analyze behavioral processes, identify examples of effective and ineffective behavior, and suggest effective ways to handle the situation depicted in the case. The cases take from 20 to 30 minutes to discuss. </p> <p> An instructor's manual is available with detailed analyses of the cases and suggestions on how to use them. The instructor's manual also includes a multiple-choice exam for each chapter with items on the major points in the chapter. The manual includes exercises for use in class (e.g., role plays), and some out-of-class activities that help students to understand how they can apply the theory and guidelines. New exercises have been added to this version of the manual. </p> <p> With its focus on effective leadership in organizations, the book is especially relevant for people who are currently managers and administrators, or, who expect to enter a leadership position after completing their college education. The book is appropriate for use as the primary text in an undergraduate or graduate course in leadership. Such courses are found in business schools, psychology departments, sociology departments, departments of educational administration, schools of public administration, and programs in health care administration. The book could be used (in combination with other texts or readings) for courses in management, supervision, educational administration, health care management, and public administration. Finally, the book will be of interest to practicing managers who are looking for something more than superficial answers to difficult questions about leadership. </p> <p> In conclusion, thanks are extended to the following people for their helpful comments: Denise Daniels, Seattle Pacific University; Georgia Sorenson, University of Maryland; Kenneth Wallace, Craven Community College; and Kimberly S.

But only two months after the war's end, Berliners had already resurrected it, reopening its gates and creating a symbol of endurance in the heart of a shattered city. As this episode shows, the Berlin zoo offers one of the most unusual--yet utterly compelling--lenses through which to view German history. This enormously popular attraction closely mirrored each of the political systems under which it existed: the authoritarian monarchy of the kaiser, the Weimar Republic, Nazi Germany, and the post-1945 democratic and communist states.<br><br>Gary Bruce provides the first English-language history of the Berlin zoo, from its founding in 1844 until the 1990 unification of the West Berlin and East Berlin zoos. At the center of the capital's social life, the Berlin zoo helped to shape German views not only of the animal world but also of the human world for more than 150 years. Given its enormous reach, the German government used the zoo to spread its political message, from the ethnographic display of Africans, Inuit, and other "exotic" peoples in the late nineteenth century to the Nazis' bizarre attempts to breed back long-extinct European cattle.<br><br>By exploring the intersection of zoology, politics, and leisure, Bruce shows why the Berlin zoo was the most beloved institution in Germany for so long: it allowed people to dream of another place, far away from an often grim reality. It is not purely coincidence that the profound connection of Berliners to their zoo intensified through the bloody twentieth century. Its exotic, iconic animals--including Rostom the elephant, Knautschke the hippo, and Evi the sun bear--seemed to satisfy, even partially, a longing for a better, more tranquil world.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gary Bruce</strong> is Professor of History at the University of Waterloo.

He explains its popularity but does not neglect the darker side of its history--the exhibiting of indigenous peoples in the nineteenth century, and the zoo's complicity in the Nazi years. Perhaps most important, readers will learn much about changing attitudes to animals from this elegant, informative work."--David Blackbourn, Vanderbilt University, author of <em>The Conquest of Nature</em><p></p><br>"Gary Bruce has compellingly chronicled the history over the two centuries of one of the most important European zoos. His narrative evokes both the human and the non-human participants in that history. Perhaps its greatest strength is that he does not present the Berlin zoo as an isolated institution. On the contrary, he interweaves his account of the zoo's internal affairs with the larger cultural and political vicissitudes experienced by the city of Berlin and by the larger German society."--Harriet Ritvo, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, author of <em>Noble Cows and Hybrid</em> <em>Zebras: Essays on Animals and History</em><p></p><br>"In this fascinating account, based on meticulous research, Gary Bruce has uncovered the ways in which the Berlin Zoo, a favorite rendezvous for Berliners, adapted to the ideology of the political regimes that followed its foundation in 1844. We see people from far-flung regions being exhibited at the zoo as ethnographic specimens; we learn how under the Nazis its scientific work was manipulated to add credence to the regime's racial policies, and how Berliners recreated their beloved zoo after its almost total destruction by Allied bombing during World War II. So iconic a symbol was the zoo that with the division of the <br>city during the Cold War, a rival, the Tierpark, was set up in East Berlin, intended not only as a place of recreation but also to reinforce communist ideology."--Caroline Grigson, author of <em>Menagerie: the History of Exotic Animals in England</em><p></p><br>"<em>Through the Lion Gate</em> is an enjoyable and interesting book and a work of admirable historical skill that can be appreciated by a broad readership."--Nigel Rothfels, <em>German Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Intriguing historical personalities emerge from Bruce's profiles of animal suppliers and zoo directors struggling to maintain the institution under volatile political conditions."--Tuska Benes, <em>History: Reviews of New Books</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Little Black Classics Reckoning (Penguin Little Black Classics)</h2><p>&#39;If marriage was the slow life-long acquittal of a debt contracted in ignorance, then marriage was a crime against human nature.&#39; This title features two moving stories of love, loss, desire and divorce, from one of the great chroniclers of nineteenth-century New York life.

She sets aside the mythology surrounding president L�zaro C�rdenas to reveal his dilemma: until he and his followers understood peasant culture, they could not govern.<br><br>This dilemma is vividly illustrated in Michoac�n. There, peasants were passionately engaged in a Catholic culture focusing on the Virgin Mary. The Cardenistas, inspired by revolutionary ideas of equality and modernity, were oblivious to the peasants' spirituality and determined to transform them. A series of dramatic conflicts forced C�rdenas to develop a government that embodied some of the peasants' complex culture.<br><br>Becker brilliantly combines concerns with culture and power and a deep historical empathy to bring to life the men and women of her story. She shows how Mexico's government today owes much of its subtlety to the peasants of Michoac�n.</p><p>"A major work in the field of Mexican revolutionary and gender studies.

Why are they always far ahead of competitors in discovering the ever-changing profit zones of their industry? Why do others languish as their traditional way of doing business turns into a no-profit zone? <br><br><b>The Profit Zone</b> provides the answers. It is an original and practical explanation of how and why high profit happens, revealing the strategies of twelve of today's great success stories--a group of companies and executives that have created over $700 billion in market value for their shareholders. More importantly, it shows the lessons that can be learned from the business design of these companies--adaptations that enabled them to always be several steps ahead of competitors in meeting customer priorities. Some examples:<br>The profit lessons any product company can learn from Jack Welch's "sell solution, not just the box" business design at GE.<br>How Nicholas Hayek's creation of low-end, profitable firewall brand--the Swatch--protects the rich profitability of the high-end products at his company<br>How Roberto Goizueta's decision that the consumer was not the only important customer created the basis for Coke's triumph's over Pepsi.<br>Why Charles Schwab's switchboard business design created a new way of doing business for millions of new customers in financial services.<br>How managers of small and mid-size businesses such as Madden Communications and middle managers in large companies have used Slywotzky and Morrison's ideas to move their companies to the profit zone.</p><p>For years, the prevailing wisdom in business was that profitability was a byproduct of market share; get the biggest piece of the market and profit will surely follow. But in the last 10 years, this formula has time and again proved itself wrong. Companies such as DEC, GM, Ford, United Airlines, Kodak, and Sears have all demonstrated that market share does not necessarily lead to profitability. <p><i>The Profit Zone</i> looks at how profit happens in today's customer-driven economy. The authors demonstrate why market share often leads to a "no-profit zone" and identify 22 profit models that have helped dozens of companies consistently make money. Included are in-depth looks at companies--Disney, GE, Microsoft, Intel, Charles Schwab--that have successfully redesigned their businesses and dramatically increased the value of their companies. Instead of focusing on market share, these innovators first looked at their customers' needs and how they could profit from fulfilling them. The book considers example after example of how the profit zone works, from Disney's theme parks to Schwab's marketing and selling of mutual funds. The final chapter is a handbook that allows managers to apply the ideas to their own companies. Clearly written and immensely practical, <i>The Profit Zone</i> deserves a place on every manager's bookshelf.</p>"<b>The Profit Zone</b> could safely come with a guarantee that it would increase a company's profit if management read it and acted on it."<br>--Phillip Kotler, Kellogg School, Northwestern University<br><br>"This important and meaningful book is must reading for anyone responsible for business strategy formulation. Slywotzky and Morrison's strategic approach is woven through a range of real-world examples that reinforce the power of creative business design and ongoing reinvention."<br>--Richard L. Keyser, chairman and CEO, W.W. Grainger, Inc.<br><br>"[The authors] show how to achieve profitable results by developing superior insight into customers and adapting a company's business design to stay ahead of customer needs, rather than attempting to do more of what you've always done faster and better. <b>The Profit Zone</b> gives the reader confidence that these ideas work through clear and detailed examples."<br>--Samuel J.

Neave explains the endocrine system and the ways in which hormones can influence brain structure and function, and presents a series of examples to demonstrate how hormones can influence specific behaviours, including sexual determination and differentiation, neurological differentiation, parental behaviours, aggressive behaviours and cognition. This introductory textbook will appeal to second and third year social science undergraduate students in psychology and biomedicine.</p><p>A detailed introduction to the fascinating science of how hormones influence brain structure and function.

The majority of all global travel entails some element of the cultural past, as hundreds of millions of people visit cultural attractions, heritage festivals, and historic places each year. The book delves into this vast form of tourism by providing a comprehensive examination of its issues, current debates, concepts and practices. It looks at the social, physical and economic impacts, which cause destinations, site managers and interpreters to consider not only how to plan and manage resources but also how to portray the past in ways that are acceptable, accurate, accessible and politically relevant. In the process, however, the depth of heritage politics, the authenticity and inauthenticity of place and experience, and the urgent need to protect living and built cultures are exposed. The book explores these and many other current issues surrounding the management of cultural resources for tourism. In order to help students relate concepts to real-world situations it combines theory and practice, is student learning oriented, is written accessibly for all readers and is empirically rich.</p><p>Dr Dallen J.

How it all began, anyway?</li></ul><p></p><p>All these questions and much, much more are answered in this essential and powerful new tool: The <em>HarperCollins Dictionary of Religion</em> -- the definitive guide to understanding religion today.</p></p><p>From the world&#39;s premier association of religion experts comes an authoritative, state-of-the-art, comprehensive A--to--Z guide to the world of religion.With the collaboration of the American Academy of Religion, an international team of scholars contributed more than 3,200 articles to this book. While entries are not signed, the forematter lists more than 300 contributed articles as well as the area editors who comprise the editorial board. The preface notes that the dictionary "seeks to expand public understanding of religion by going beyond the usual concentration on major world religions" ; thus the scope includes all geographic areas from the Paleolithic era to present times.<p>While the basic organization is that of a dictionary with concise entries on specific topics such as names, rituals, places, and festivals and more extensive entries for such topics as <i>Mysticism</i> or <i>Japanese Folk Religion</i>, there are also 11 long feature articles about major world religions, broad categories of religion such as the religions of antiquity, and an essay on the academic study of religion. Maps and time lines are included where appropriate. The broad essays on historical religious traditions are complemented by entries on such central topics as art and architecture, authoritative texts, the festal cycle, etc. Thus the broad essay on Islam is related to such articles as <i>Islam (ethics)</i> and <i>Islam (life cycle)</i>.</p><p>The preface notes that the dictionary devotes significant attention to religions of traditional peoples, extinct religions, and new religious movements. While not as extensive as <i>America's Alternative Religions</i> (SUNY Press, 1995) for North America, there is indeed fairly comprehensive coverage of new religious movements throughout the world. While mainstream Christianity is well represented in the dictionary, it seems to be assumed that information on this faith is readily available in other resources. For example, two lines are given to the concept <i>Guardian Angel</i> while <i>Guardian Spirit</i> in Native American traditions is 38 lines. Articles that compare concepts in religions are useful, but once again emphasis is often on non-Christian religions. Under <i>Death,</i> for example, the concept is discussed only in terms of Islam and Japanese Buddhism.</p><p>The dictionary tries to overcome the fragmentation inherent in such a format with a cross-referencing system that is only partially effective. There are no internal cross-references indicating that names or concepts mentioned in articles also have separate entries. Under <i>Pope</i> there is only a terse three-line definition and no cross-reference to longer treatment under <i>Papacy</i>. There are no bibliographies, but there is a wealth of information about scholarly sources and major authors within the entries.</p><p>This is a mass of information for the price. For large libraries it is no substitute for the 16-volume <i>Encyclopedia of Religion</i> (Macmillan, 1987), but the one-volume format is handy for reference work, and college students will find it a resource for information about religions not familiar in the West. The pronunciation indications provided are helpful. The level of writing is scholarly and occasionally not accessible to even the educated lay reader. Public and academic libraries will definitely want to purchase; high-school libraries will not find it as useful. <i></i></p></p><h2>Analysis of Nominal Data (Quantitative Applications in the Social Sciences)</h2><p>The updated second edition offers expanded discussions of the chi square test of significance and the potential measures of association available for use with categoric data.

Detailing the numerous ways that our understanding of food has narrowed, such as&nbsp;its price per ounce, combination of nutrients, yield per acre, or calories, the book argues for a more contextual&nbsp;view of food when debating its affordability. The first edition, published in 2011, was widely praised for its innovative approach and readability.</p> <p>In this new edition the author brings all data and citations fully up to date. Increased coverage is given to many topics including climate change, aquaculture, financialization, BRICS countries, food-based social movements, gender and ethnic issues, critical public health and land succession. There is also greater discussion about successful cases of social change throughout all chapters,&nbsp;by including&nbsp;new text boxes that emphasize these more&nbsp;positive messages. </p> <p>The author shows why today's global food system produces just the opposite of what it promises. The food produced under this regime is in fact exceedingly expensive. Many of these costs will be paid for in other ways or by future generations and cheap food today may mean expensive food tomorrow. By systematically assessing these costs the book delves into issues related, but not limited, to international development, national security, healthcare, industrial meat production, organic farming, corporate responsibility, government subsidies, food aid and global commodity markets. It is shown that exploding the myth of cheap food requires we have at our disposal a host of practices and policies. </p></p><p><p><strong>Michael Carolan</strong> is a Professor in the Department of Sociology and&nbsp;Associate Dean for Research and Graduate Affairs, College of Liberal Arts, Colorado State University, USA.

Through comprehensive and detailed analyses of such important texts as The History of Madness in the Age of Reason, The Birth of the Clinic, The Order of Things, and The Archaeology of Knowledge, the author provides a lucid exposition of Foucault&#39;s &#34;archaeological&#34; approach to the history of thought, a method for uncovering the &#34;unconscious&#34; structures that set boundaries on the thinking of a given epoch. The book casts Foucault in a new light, relating his work to Gaston Bachelard&#39;s philosophy of science and Georges Canguilhem&#39;s history of science. This perspective yields a new and valuable understanding of Foucault as a historian and philosopher of science, balancing and complementing the more common view of him as primarily a social critic and theorist.</p><p>Comprehensive and detailed analyses of such important texts as The History of Madness in the Age of Reason, The Birth of the Clinic, The Order of Things, and The Archaeology of Knowledge are included in this introduction to Foucault.This book is an important introduction to an end critical interpretation of the work of the major French thinker Michel Foucault.</p><h2>Beowulf</h2><p>SANTIAGO GARCIA and DAVID RUBIN unite to bring forward the myth of Beowulf, which has endured for a thousand years, inspired an epic poem, become a foundational piece of English literature, and influenced generations of authors: from J.R.R. Tolkien and Seamus Heaney to a multitude of Hollywood screenwriters.<br><br>BEOWULF tells of the tale of a Scandinavian hero in lands that would become what is now Denmark and Sweden. A monster, Grendel, has arrived in the kingdom of the Danes, devouring its men and women for over a decade until Beowulf arrives to save them.<br><br>GARCIA and RUBIN faithfully follow the original story for a new version that is neither revisionist nor postmodern, but captures the tone and important details of the poem, translating its potent, epic resonance and melancholy into a contemporary comic that isn't standard swords and sorcery or heroic fantasy fare, but rather an ancient story with a modern perspective that remains respectful of the source material.<br></p><p></p><h2>A House For Mr Biswas (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Millennium Project edition without library markings, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned.

Kenneth Allan and new co-author Sarah Daynes focus on the specific views of each theorist, rather than schools of thought, and highlight modernity and postmodernity to help contemporary readers understand how classical sociological theory applies to their lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></p><p>Kenneth Allan received his PhD in sociology from the University of California, Riverside (1995), and is currently professor of Sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro (UNCG). Before moving to UNCG, he directed the Teaching Assistant Development Program at the University of California, Riverside, and coedited<i> Training Teaching Assistants, 2nd Edition</i> (1997), published by the American Sociological Association. In addition to teaching classical and contemporary theory at UNCG, Allan also supervised UNCG&#x2019;s sociology iSchool program, which offered online introduction to sociology classes to high school students across North Carolina, has designed several online courses for both the college and department, and has regularly taught graduate pedagogy courses. Allan&#x2019;s research areas include theory, culture, and the self. He has authored several works in the area of theory, including multiple textbooks covering classical and contemporary theory, as well as <i>The Meaning of Culture: Moving the Postmodern Critique Forward</i>, and <i>A Primer in Social and Sociological Theory: Toward a Sociology of Citizenship</i>. His current projects include a social history of American individualism, a sociological analysis of consciousness and self, as well as a novel based in early 20th century American life."I have [been] using Allan&#x2032;s books since I started teaching social theory courses as an adjunct in grad school. [He] takes complicated materials that can be very dense and obtuse [and presents] concepts in a straightforward manner. The writing clarity stands on its own." -- William G. Holt Published On: 2015-09-23<br><br><p>"Allan does a much better job of setting the scene for [an] understanding of Classical Theory than other texts I have used in the past. He also speaks in lay terms so that undergraduates [can] grasp the material." </p> -- Eileen Connell Published On: 2015-09-02<br><br>"I feel that the Sociological Imagination sections, Theoretical Hints, Enduring Issues, and Theory Toolboxes are especially useful to my students." -- Stephanie Bucy Published On: 2015-09-19<br><br><p>"[<em>Explorations in Classical Sociology Theory</em>] makes accessible to undergraduates rather difficult material.

This shift began in the nineteenth century and is now pervasive in many aspects of everyday experience. In the arts especially, the increasing importance of process over product has promoted a profound change in the relationship between artist and audience. But while artists have been among the most perceptive interpreters of Buddhism in the West, art historians and critics have been slow to develop the intellectual tools to analyze the impact of Buddhist concepts. This timely, multi-faceted volume explores the relationships between Buddhist practice and the contemporary arts in lively essays by writers from a range of disciplines and in revealing interviews with some of the most influential artists of our time. Elucidating the common ground between the creative mind, the perceiving mind, and the meditative mind, the contributors tackle essential questions about the relationship of art and life.<br><br>Among the writers are curators, art critics, educators, and Buddhist commentators in psychology, literature, and cognitive science. They consider the many Western artists today who recognize the Buddhist notion of emptiness, achieved through focused meditation, as a place of great creative potential for the making and experiencing of art. The artists featured in the interviews, all internationally recognized, include Bill Viola, and Ann Hamilton. Extending earlier twentieth-century aesthetic interests in blurring the boundaries of art and life, the artists view art as a way of life, a daily practice, in ways parallel to that of the Buddhist practitioner. Their works, woven throughout the book, richly convey how Buddhism has been both a source for and a lens through which we now perceive art.</p><p>&#34;Eminently readable and extremely meaningful. The contributors tackle essential questions about the relationship of art and life. The book is also very timely, offering a way to approach Buddhism through unexpected channels.&#34;-Lynn Gumpert, Director, Grey Art Gallery, New York University<b>Jacquelynn Baas</b> is Director Emeritus of the University of California, Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive and an independent scholar. <b>Mary Jane Jacob </b>is Professor at The School of the Art Institute of Chicago and an independent curator.</p><h2>Writing Superheroes: Contemporary Childhood, Popular Culture, and Classroom Literacy (Language and Literacy Series)</h2><p>Based on an ethnographic study in an urban classroom of seven to nine-year-olds, this work examines how young school children use popular culture, especially superhero stories, in the unofficial peer social world and in the official school literary curriculum. In one sense, this work is about children &#34;writing superheroes&#34; - about children appropriating superhero stories in their fiction writing and dramatic play on the playground and in the classroom. These stories offer children identities as powerful people who do battle against evil and win. The stories, however, also reveal limiting ideological assumptions about relations between people - boys and girls, adults and children, people of varied heritages, physical demeanours and social classes. The book, then, is about children as &#34;writing superheroes&#34;. With the assistance of their teacher, the observed children became superheroes of another sort, able to take on powerful cultural storylines. In this book, Anne Dyson examines how the children&#39;s interest in and conflicts about commercial culture give rise to both literacy and social learning, including learning how to participate in a community of differences.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Concept Mapping in Nursing: Critical Thinking in Action</h2><p>Introduction to Concept Mapping in Nursing provides the foundation for what a concept map is and how to create a map that applies theory to practice.

This unflinching portrait of the man who sired three of America&#x2019;s most important twentieth-century political figures introduces a wealth of new information about Kennedy&#x2019;s questionable financial practices, his Hollywood exploits, his tenure as ambassador to Great Britain, and his very risky relationship with organized crime. <p>Author Ted Schwarz reveals that, long before his family&#x2019;s name became synonymous with wealth, glamour, political idealism, and agonizing personal tragedy, Joe Kennedy was on the move. From baseball scams he concocted as an adolescent to his cynical manipulation of Franklin Roosevelt&#x2019;s son, Kennedy showed few scruples when it came to getting ahead in the world. Even his long and successful courtship of Rose Fitzgerald, daughter of Boston&#x2019;s first Irish mayor, was calculated to advance his career and improve his standing in the community.</p> <p>Drawing on previously untapped sources, including interviews with Meyer Lansky&#x2019;s accountant, who knew Joe in Miami, and the files of a private investigator who worked both for and against the Kennedy family for many years, Schwarz provides a rare peek into Joseph Kennedy&#x2019;s most secret activities and most public accomplishments. He discloses how Joe prevented Rose from being humiliated by his very public affair with screen siren Gloria Swanson, what made him think that he could safely do business with Al Capone, and much more.</p> <p>Schwarz also assesses Kennedy&#x2019;s accomplishments and failures in business and politics, including the creation of the vertical merger, his transformation of the Hollywood studio into a product business manufacturer, and his dismal performance as Ambassador to Britain.</p> <p>Complete with fascinating portraits of Joe&#x2019;s father, P. J. Kennedy, Mayor John "Honey Fitz" Fitzgerald, and a huge supporting cast of politicians, movie stars, gangsters, con artists, and captains of industry, Joseph P. Kennedy tells a classic American tale of ambition, greed, triumph, and tragedy. It is must-reading for Kennedy buffs, biography lovers, business readers, and anyone interested in the complex and controversial story behind the patriarch of America&#x2019;s most loved, most hated, and most talked-about family.</p></p><h2>Slaves Waiting for Sale: Abolitionist Art and the American Slave Trade</h2><p><p>In 1853, Eyre Crowe, a young British artist, visited a slave auction in Richmond, Virginia. Harrowed by what he witnessed, he captured the scene in sketches that he would later develop into a series of illustrations and paintings, including the culminating painting, <i>Slaves Waiting for Sale, Richmond, Virginia</i>.</p>This innovative book uses Crowe&#x2019;s paintings to explore the texture of the slave trade in Richmond, Charleston, and New Orleans, the evolving iconography of abolitionist art, and the role of visual culture in the transatlantic world of abolitionism. Tracing Crowe&#x2019;s trajectory from Richmond across the American South and back to London&#x2014;where his paintings were exhibited just a few weeks after the start of the Civil War&#x2014;Maurie D. McInnis illuminates not only how his abolitionist art was inspired and made, but also how it influenced the international public&#x2019;s grasp of slavery in America. With almost 140 illustrations, <i>Slaves Waiting for Sale</i> brings a fresh perspective to the American slave trade and abolitionism as we enter the sesquicentennial of the Civil War.</p><p><b>Maurie D.

Historian John Hardman disputes both these versions in a fascinating new biography of the ill-fated monarch. Based in part on new scholarship that has emerged over the past two decades, Hardman&#x2019;s illuminating study describes a highly educated ruler who, though indecisive, possessed sharp political insight and&nbsp;a talent for foreign policy; who often saw the dangers ahead but could not or would not prevent them; and whose great misfortune was to be caught in the violent center of a major turning point in history.<br><br> Hardman&#x2019;s dramatic reassessment of the reign of Louis XVI sheds a bold new light on the man, his actions, his world, and his policies, including the king&#x2019;s support for America&#x2019;s War of Independence, the intricate workings of his court, the disastrous Diamond Necklace Affair, and Louis&#x2019;s famous dash to Varennes.</p><p><b>John Hardman </b>is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on the French Revolution and the author of several well-regarded books on the subject.

I have incorporated suggestions of several reviewers by changing the order of the selections, beginning with the more "existential" topics and then going on to the more abstract issues. The first chapter, now entitled "The Varieties of Religious Experience" might have been headed the "phenomenon" of religion, though I feared that this would impose too great an expectation on the offerings of that section. The readings address the question of how the religious impulse arises, whether in religious experience, the feelings of the numinous, or the encounter with the Eternal Thou. Also, in an increasingly global marketplace both for the exchange of goods and services as well as the exchange of ideas, it seemed necessary to address the pluralistic nature of religious faith, and the new selection by John Hick&#x2014;<i>The Pluralistic Hypothesis</i>&#x2014;does precisely that. </p> <p> The readings in the chapter on religion and human destiny also respond to readers' requests for more classic sources. New in this section are excerpts from Epicurus, Plato, and the New Testament. This return to classics is found also in the chapter detailing arguments for God's existence with selections from Paley on the design argument and Kant on the moral argument. In teaching this course I find that students are intensely interested in the divine attributes and with such questions as divine foreknowledge and human freedom. The new selection from J. S. Mill on the divine attributes provides an opportunity to discuss this topic in the context of a theodicy derived solely from natural theology. </p> <p> The following chapter dealing with faith and reason is supplemented by an extract from Paul Tillich's <i>Dynamics of Faith</i> detailing his view of faith as ultimate concern. This topic is not only important in showing a possible way of understanding faith but also in providing students with a vocabulary to discuss this important issue. </p> <p> New to the chapter on religious language is Rosemary Ruether's important paper on The Female Nature of God. Coming at the end of the section analyzing the nonliteral use of language when speaking of the divine, this piece shows how our understanding of the divine nature can be enhanced by the feminine imagery found in traditional God talk. All the new readings in this edition respond to users' requests for lengthier selections with shorter introductory summaries. </p> <p> This edition continues to include selections from Eastern as well as Western religious traditions and follows the general plan of this text to combine the best features of a text and a reader. The book attempts to provide both clear and understandable analysis, coupled with important primary-source readings. The topics chosen have a permanent place in the philosophy of religion, but users of the book do not need to use the chapters in the order in which they are presented here. </p> <p> I am also indebted to David Bruce for his help with research, proofreading, and indexing.

Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, this study examines these different female representations and their significance within the context of the poem and Greek culture. A central theme of the book is the visualization of the <em>Odyssey</em>'s female characters by ancient artists, and several essays discuss the visual and iconographic implications of Odysseus' female encounters as depicted in Greek, Etruscan, and Roman art. The distinguished contributors--from the fields of classical studies, comparative literature, art history, and archaeology--are A.J. Graham, Seth L.

To one degree or another, a wave of dysregulated affect &#x2013; a dissociated "tsunami" &#x2013; hits the immature mind, and if left relationally unprocessed leaves a fearful shadow that weakens future ability to regulate affect in an interpersonal context and reduces the capacity to trust, sometimes even experience, authentic human discourse. </p> <p>In his fascinating third book, Philip Bromberg deepens his inquiry into the nature of what is therapeutic about the therapeutic relationship: its capacity to move the psychoanalytic process along a path that, bit by bit, shrinks&nbsp;a patient's vulnerability to the pursuing shadow of affective destabilization while simultaneously increasing intersubjectivity. What takes places along this path does not happen because "this" led to "that," but because the path is its own destination &#x2013; a joint achievement that underlies what is termed in the subtitle "the growth of the relational mind."</p> <p>Expanding the self-state perspective of <em>Standing in the Spaces </em>(1998) and <em>Awakening the Dreamer </em>(2006), Bromberg explores what he holds to be the two nonlinear but interlocking rewards of successful treatment &#x2013; healing and growth. The psychoanalytic relationship is illuminated not as a medium for treating an illness but as an opportunity for two human beings to live together in the affectively enacted shadow of the past, allowing it to be cognitively symbolized by new cocreated experience that is processed by thought and language &#x2013; freeing the patient's natural capacity to feel trust and joy as part of an enduring regulatory stability that permits life to be lived with creativity, love, interpersonal spontaneity, and a greater sense of meaning.</p></p><p><p>A preeminent writer on the understanding of trauma and dissociative phenomena, Philip M.

At its heart is the daily work of healing which, for Bromberg, is the work of 'collision and negotiation,' of the struggle of patient and analyst to find common ground after experiences of dissociative enactment. Through the intensity of such shared but separate not-me moments, the ability to acknowledge and bear conflict is mutually developed. These richly wrought essays poignantly describe the process of nurturance, healing, and growth, drawing not only on psychoanalytic theory but on music, film, poetry, and fiction</em> &#x2013; <em>all engagingly deployed to convey the nuances of&nbsp;shifting states of being.

And two decades away from publishing an endearing autobiographical book that introduced him to non-physicists as a straight-talking scientist interested in everything from cracking safes to playing drums. But in November 1964, to students at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, he was already a star and they received him as such. Feynman came to deliver a series of lectures. Strains of "Far above Cayuga's Waters" rang out from the Cornell Chimes. The provost introduced Feynman as an instructor and physicist par excellence, but also, of course, as an accomplished bongo drummer. Feynman strode onto the stage to the kind of applause reserved for performing artists, and opened his lecture with this observation: "It's odd, but in the infrequent occasions when I have been called upon in a formal place to play the bongo drums, the introducer never seems to find it necessary to mention that I also do theoretical physics."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>By his sixth lecture, Feynman dispensed with any preamble, even a token "Hello" to the clapping students, and jumped straight into how our intuition, which is suited to dealing with everyday things that we can see and hear and touch, fails when it comes to understanding nature at very small scales.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And often, he said, it's experiments that challenge our intuitive view of the world. "Then we see unexpected things," said Feynman. "We see things that are very far from what we could have imagined. And so our imagination is stretched to the utmost-not, as in fiction, to imagine things which aren't really there. But our imagination is stretched to the utmost just to comprehend those things which are there. And it's this kind of a situation that I want to talk about."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The lecture was about quantum mechanics, the physics of the very small things; in particular, it was about the nature of light and subatomic bits of matter such as electrons. In other words, it was about the nature of reality. Do light and electrons show wavelike behavior (like water does)? Or do they act like particles (like grains of sand do)? Turns out that saying yes or no would be both correct and incorrect. Any attempt to visualize the behavior of the microscopic, subatomic entities makes a mockery of our intuition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They behave in their own inimitable way," said Feynman. "Which, technically, could be called the 'quantum-mechanical' way. They behave in a way that is like nothing that you have ever seen before. Your experience with things that you have seen before is inadequate-is incomplete. The behavior of things on a very tiny scale is simply different. They do not behave just like particles. They do not behave just like waves."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But at least light and electrons behave in "exactly the same" way, said Feynman. "That is, they're both screwy."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Feynman cautioned the audience that the lecture was going to be difficult because it would challenge their widely held views about how nature works: "But the difficulty, really, is psychological and exists in the perpetual torment that results from your saying to yourself 'But how can it be like that?' Which really is a reflection of an uncontrolled, but I say utterly vain, desire to see it in terms of some analogy with something familiar. I will not describe it in terms of an analogy with something familiar. I'll simply describe it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And so, to make his point over the course of an hour of spellbinding oratory, Feynman focused on the "one experiment which has been designed to contain all of the mystery of quantum mechanics, to put you up against the paradoxes and mysteries and peculiarities of nature."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was the double-slit experiment. It's difficult to imagine a simpler experiment-or, as we'll discover over the course of this book, one more confounding. We start with a source of light. Place in front of the source a sheet of opaque material with two narrow, closely spaced slits or openings. This creates two paths for the light to go through. On the other side of the opaque sheet is a screen. What would you expect to see on the screen?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer, at least in the context of the world we are familiar with, depends on what one thinks is the nature of light. In the late seventeenth century and all of the eighteenth century, Isaac Newton's ideas dominated our view of light. He argued that light was made of tiny particles, or "corpuscles," as he called them. Newton's "corpuscular theory of light" was partly formulated to explain why light, unlike sound, cannot bend around corners. Light must be made of particles, Newton argued, since particles don't curve or bend in the absence of external forces.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In his lecture, when Feynman analyzed the double-slit experiment, he first considered the case of a source firing particles at the two slits. To accentuate the particle nature of the source, he urged the audience to imagine that instead of subatomic particles (of which electrons and particles of light would be examples), we were to fire bullets from a gun-which "come in lumps." To avoid too much violent imagery (what with bombs in the prologue, and a thought experiment with gunpowder to come), let's imagine a source that spews particles of sand rather than bullets; we know that sand comes in lumps, though the lumps are much, much smaller than bullets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>First, let's do the experiment with either the left slit or the right slit closed. Let's take it that the source is firing grains of sand at high enough speeds that they have straight trajectories. When we do this, the grains of sand that get through the slits mostly hit the region of the screen directly behind the open slit, with the numbers tapering off on either side. The higher the height of the graph, the more the number of grains of sand reaching that location on the screen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now, what should we see if both slits are open? As expected, each grain of sand passes through one or the other opening and reaches the other side. The distribution of the grains of sand on the far screen is simply the sum of what goes through each slit. It's a demonstration of the intuitive and sensible behavior of the non-quantum world of everyday experience, the classical world described so well by Newton's laws of motion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>To be convinced that this is indeed what happens with particles of sand, let's orient the device such that the sand is now falling down onto the barrier with two slits. Our intuition clearly tells us that two mounds should form beneath the two openings.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turning the experiment back to its original position, let's dispense with the sand and consider a source that's emitting light, and assume that light's made of Newtonian corpuscles. Informed by our experiment with sand particles, we'd expect to see two strips of light on the screen, one behind the right slit and one behind the left slit, each strip of light fading off to the sides, leading to a distribution of light that is simply the sum of the light you'd get passing through each slit.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that's not what happens. Light, it seems, does not behave as if it's made of particles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Even before Newton's time, there were observations that challenged his theory of the particle nature of light. For example, light changes course when going from one medium to another-say, from air to glass and back into air (this phenomenon, called refraction, is what allows us to make optical lenses). Refraction can't be easily explained if you think of light as particles traveling through air and glass, because it requires positing an external force to change the direction of light when it goes from air to glass and from glass to air. But refraction can be explained if light is thought of as a wave (the speed of the wave would be different in air than in glass, explaining the change in direction as light goes from one type of material to another). This is exactly what Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens proposed in the 1600s. Huygens argued that light is a wave much like a sound wave, and since sound waves are essentially vibrations of the medium in which they are traveling, Huygens argued that light too is made of vibrations of a medium called ether that pervades the space around us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This was a serious theory put forth by an enormously gifted scientist. Huygens was a physicist, astronomer, and mathematician. He made telescopes by grinding lenses himself, and discovered Saturn's moon Titan (the first probe to land on Titan, in 2005, was named Huygens in his honor). He independently discovered the Orion nebula. In 1690, he published his Trait de la Lumi re (Treatise on Light), in which he expounded his wave theory of light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Newton and Huygens were contemporaries, but Newton's star shone brighter. After all, he had come up with the laws of motion and the universal law of gravitation, which explained everything from the arc of a ball thrown across a field to the movement of planets around the sun. Besides, Newton was a polymath of considerable renown (as a mathematician, he gave us calculus, and even ventured into chemistry, theology, and writing biblical commentaries, not to mention all his work in physics). It was no wonder that his corpuscular theory of light, despite its shortcomings, overshadowed Huygens's ideas of light being wavelike. It'd take another polymath to show up Newton when it came to understanding light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thomas Young has been called �The Last Man Who Knew Everything.� In 1793, barely twenty years of age, he explained how our eyes focus upon objects at different distances, based partly on his own dissection of an ox�s eyes. A year later, on the strength of that work, Young was made a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1796 he became �doctor of physic, surgery, and midwifery.� When he was in his forties, Young helped Egyptologists decipher the Rosetta stone (which had inscriptions in three scripts: Greek, hieroglyphics, and something unknown). And in between becoming a medical doctor, getting steeped in Egyptology, and even studying Indo-European languages, Young delivered one of the most intriguing lectures in the history of physics. The venue was the Royal Society of London, and the date, November 24, 1803. Young stood in front of that august audience, this time as a physicist describing a simple and elegant homespun experiment, which, in his mind, had unambiguously established the true nature of light and proved Newton wrong.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The experiments I am about to relate . . . may be repeated with great ease, whenever the sun shines," Young told the audience.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Whenever the sun shines. Young wasn't overstating the simplicity of his experiment. "I made a small hole in a window-shutter, and covered it with a piece of thick paper, which I perforated with a fine needle," he said. The pinhole let through a ray of light, a sunbeam. "I brought into the sunbeam a slip of card, about one-thirtieth of an inch in breadth, and observed its shadow, either on the wall, or on other cards held at different distances."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If light is made of particles, Young's "slip of card" would have cast a sharp shadow on the wall in front, because the card would have blocked some of the particles. And if so, Newton would have been proved right.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If, however, light is made of waves, as Huygens claimed, then the card would have merely impeded the waves, like a rock impedes flowing water, and the wave would have gone around the card, taking two paths, one on either side of the card. The two paths of light would eventually recombine at the wall opposite the window shutter to create a characteristic pattern: a row of alternating bright and dark stripes. Such stripes, also known as interference fringes, are created when two waves overlap. Crucially, the central fringe would be bright, exactly where you'd expect a dark shadow if light were made of particles.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We know about interference from our everyday experience of waves of water. Think of an ocean wave hitting two openings in a coastal breakwall. New waves emerge from each opening (a process called diffraction) and travel onward, where they overlap and interfere with each other. In regions where the crests of both waves arrive at the same time, there's constructive interference and the water is at its highest (analogous to bright fringes of light); and in regions where the crest from one wave arrives at the same time as the trough of the other, there's destructive interference and the water is at its lowest (corresponding to dark fringes).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Young saw such optical interference fringes. Specifically, since he was working with sunlight, which contains light of all colors, he saw a central region that was flanked by fringes of colors. The central region, upon closer inspection, was seen to be made of light and dark fringes. The numbers of these fringes and their widths depended on how far away the pinhole in the window shutter was from the screen or wall. And the middle of the central region was always white (a bright fringe). He had shown that light is wavelike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There must have been disbelief in the audience, for Young was going against Newton's ideas. Even before Young's lecture, articles written anonymously in the Edinburgh Review had been heavily critical of his work. The author, who turned out to be a barrister named Henry Brougham (he became Lord Chancellor of England in 1830), was scathing, calling Young's work "destitute of every species of merit" and "the unmanly and unfruitful pleasure of a boyish and prurient imagination."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was anything but. Soon enough, Young's ideas got further support from other physicists. His experiment led to what's now called the double-slit experiment and was in fact the first formulation of it-the very same experiment whose virtues Feynman extolled during his lecture at Cornell. In the more standard double-slit experiment, Young's sunbeam is replaced by a source of light. And instead of a "slip of card" placed in the sunbeam's path to create two paths for the light, the double-slit experiment creates two paths of light by letting the light fall on an opaque barrier with two narrow slits or openings through which the light can pass. And on the screen on the far side, you see an interference pattern, essentially fringes similar to what Young saw on the wall opposite the window shutter (if the screen is a photographic plate, or a piece of glass coated with photosensitive material, then the image can be thought of as a film negative: dark regions will form where the film is being exposed to light). You don't see just two strips tapering away, which you'd expect if light behaved as if it came in lumps. It's behaving like a wave.</p></p><h2>Can&#39;t We Make Moral Judgements?</h2><p>In this book, Mary Midgely turns a spotlight on the fashionable view that we no longer need or use moral judgements.

None of the men who rode with Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer to his &#x201c;Last Stand&#x201d; survived to tell the tale, but this stunning photography book provides a view of the battlefield as it must have existed in 1876. To create Where Custer Fell, authors James S. Brust, Brian C. Pohanka, and Sandy Barnard searched for elusive documents and photographs, made countless trips to the battlefield, and scrutinized all available sources. Each chapter begins with a concise, lively description of an episode in the battle. The narratives are graphically illustrated by historical photos, which are presented alongside modern photos of the same location on the battlefield. The book also features detailed maps and photographs of battle participants and the early photographers who attempted to tell their story.</p><p><p><strong>James S.

Rothman shows that the complexity of their history can be unraveled and usefully interpreted. By identifying the salient influences that converged in the tumultuous 1820s and 1830s that led to a particular ideology in the development of prisons and asylums, Rothman provides a compelling argument that is historically informed and socially instructive. He weaves a comprehensive story that sets forth and portrays a series of interrelated events, influences, and circumstances that are shown to be connected to the development of prisons and asylums. Rothman demonstrates that meaningful historical interpretation must be based upon not one but a series of historical events and circumstances, their connections and ultimate consequences. Thus, the history of prisons and asylums in the youthful United States is revealed to be complex but not so complex that it cannot be disentangled, described, understood, and applied.</p> <p>This reissue of a classic study addresses a core concern of social historians and criminal justice professionals: Why in the early nineteenth century did a single generation of Americans resort for the first time to institutional care for its convicts, mentally ill, juvenile delinquents, orphans, and adult poor? Rothman's compelling analysis links this phenomenon to a desperate effort by democratic society to instill a new social order as it perceived the loosening of family, church, and community bonds. As debate persists on the wisdom and effectiveness of these inherited solutions, <em>The Discovery of the Asylum</em> offers a fascinating reflection on our past as well as a source of inspiration for a new century of students and professionals in criminal justice, corrections, social history, and law enforcement.</p></p><p><p><em>David J.

He has read each of the 765 books that <i>Booknotes</i> has featured. Lamb lives in Arlington, Virginia.This rather desultory anthology gathers some 72 sessions of C-SPAN&#x2019;s popular author-interview series, this time covering prominent nonfiction books on American history. As in the three previous Booknotes anthologies, the interviews are edited to remove host Lamb&#x2019;s side of the dialogue; at their best, they read like chatty, informal essays. But the fact remains that no amount of editing can impart to conversational exchanges the kind of structure, focus and polish that makes an essay readable. In consequence, these pieces&#x2014;lacking the orienting and framing clues that the host&#x2019;s questions provide to the TV audience&#x2014;tend to lurch from one topic to another, rarely settling down to a coherent theme. It doesn&#x2019;t help that so many of the books discussed are biographies, which can give rise to perfunctory first-he-did-this-and-then-he-did-that narrative rehashes. The most coherent and interesting pieces are the polemical ones, like Victor Davis Hanson&#x2019;s diatribe against American immigration policy and James Loewen&#x2019;s critique of high school American history texts, both of which have the vigorous drive of an oft-rehearsed stump speech. But none of them really surmounts the problem that, no matter how lively it may sound on TV, conversational English can be very tedious to read&#x2014;coarse and flat, stripped of inflection and rhythm, full of stammering repetitions and the sort of vivacious colloquialism ("For example, Union Station in Washington D. C., in 1909, she busted up a saloon and who knows? I&#x2019;m not sure why she did that" blurts Fran Grace about temperance crusader Carrie Nation) that comes off as discombobulated rambling on the page. There are eminent personages aplenty in here, but they&#x2019;re not shown in their best light. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The expeditions of Julius Caesar and the Claudian invasion of 43 CE, up to the traditional end of Roman Britain in the fifth century CE, brought fundamental and lasting changes to the island. Not least among these was a pantheon of new classical deities and religious systems, along with a clutch of exotic eastern cults, including Christianity. But what homegrown deities, cults, and cosmologies did the Romans encounter in Britain, and how did the British react to the changes? Under Roman rule, the old gods and their adherents were challenged, adopted, adapted, absorbed, and reconfigured.</p><p>Miranda Aldhouse- Green balances literary, archaeological, and iconographic evidence (and scrutinizes the shortcomings of each) to illuminate the complexity of religion and belief in Roman Britain. She examines the two-way traffic of cultural exchange and the interplay between imported and indigenous factions to reveal how this period on the cusp between prehistory and history knew many of the same tensions, ideologies, and issues of identity still relevant today.</p> 110 illustrations</p><p>Miranda Aldhouse-Green is Professor of Archaeology at Cardiff University. She has published widely on the Celts, including for Dictionary of Celtic Myth and Legend, Exploring the World of the Druids, and The Celtic Myths.</p><h2>The Foundations of Modern Political Thought, Vol. 2: The Age of Reformation</h2><p>A two-volume study of political thought from the late thirteenth to the end of the sixteenth century, the decisive period of transition from medieval to modern political theory. The work is intended to be both an introduction to the period for students, and a presentation and justification of a particular approach to the interpretation of historical texts. Quentin Skinner gives an outline account of all the principal texts of the period, discussing in turn the chief political writings of Dante, Marsiglio, Bartolus, Machiavelli, Erasmus and more, Luther and Calvin, Bodin and the Calvinist revolutionaries. But he also examines a very large number of lesser writers in order to explain the general social and intellectual context in which these leading theorists worked. He thus presents the history not as a procession of &#39;classic texts&#39; but are more readily intelligible. He traces by this means the gradual emergence of the vocabulary of modern political thought, and in particular the crucial concept of the State. We are given an insight into the actual processes of the formation of ideologies and into some of the linkages between political theory and practice. Professor Skinner has been awarded the Balzan Prize Life Time Achievement Award for Political Thought, History and Theory.

Patricia Herlihy is research professor at the Watson Institute for International Studies, Brown University, and professor emeritus of history, Brown University. She is the author of Odessa: A History, 1774-1914 in English and Ukrainian. Other contributors include Bel Kaufman, Sholem Aleichem&#x2019;s granddaughter; Odessa historians Alexander Rozenboim and Oleg Gubar; and translator Antonina Bouis.Odessa was founded by Catherine the Great in 1794 and soon became an important center of Jewish culture. This book started out as a collection of postcards of this Russian city on the Black Sea and later came to include illustrations, Jewish periodicals, advertisements, photographs, and circus posters from museums and libraries. There's an essay by Patricia Herlihy and contributions by Bel Kaufman (the granddaughter of Sholem Aleichem, who came from Odessa), Oleg Gubar, and Alexander Rozenboim. Iljine writes that he intended the book's title to remind readers of the vibrant life of the city between the mid-1800s and the Russian Revolution of 1917, since these times were also documented in photographs. Herlihy gives a history of Odessa's nightlife, resorts, theaters, schools, criminal underworld, synagogues, philanthropic societies, phenomenal growth, the colorful mix of ethnic groups, and organizations that provided a defense against pogroms. This opulent book, with 215 illustrations--166 in color--and an informative text, goes a long way in preserving the history of this renowned city. <i>George Cohen</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With subjects ranging from the writer&#x2019;s own &#x201c;migrant childhood&#x201d; to the need to protect what remains of the great western wilderness (which Stegner dubs &#x201c;the geography of hope&#x201d;) to poignant profiles of western writers such as John Steinbeck and Norman Maclean, this collection is a riveting testament to the power of place. At the same time it communicates vividly the sensibility and range of this most gifted of American writers, historians, and environmentalists.</p><p>&#x201c;No one has written more or better about the West, past and present, than Wallace Stegner.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>USA Today</i><b>T. H. Watkins</b> (1936&#x2013;2000) was the first Wallace Stegner Dis-tinguished Professor of Western American Studies at Montana State University.

Today a woman relies on what she sees in a test result or a digital sonogram image to confirm her pregnancy. A private experience once mediated by women themselves has become a public experience interpreted and controlled by medical professionals. In <i>Disembodying Women</i>, Barbara Duden takes a closer look at this contemporary transformation of women&#x2019;s experience of pregnancy. She suggests that advances in technology and parallel changes in public discourse have refrained pregnancy as a managed process, the mother as an ecosystem, and the fetus as an endangered species.</p><p>Drawing on extensive historical research, Duden traces the graphic techniques-from anatomists&#x2019; drawings to woodcuts to X-rays and ultrasound-used to &#x201c;flay&#x201d; the female body and turn it inside out. Emphasizing the iconic power of the visual within twentieth-century culture, Duden follows the process by which the pregnant woman&#x2019;s flesh has been peeled away to uncover scientific data. Lennart Nilsson&#x2019;s now-famous photographs of the embryo published in <i>Life</i> magazine in the mid-1960s stand in stark contrast to representations of the invisible unborn in medieval iconography or sixteenth-century painting. Illumination has given way to illustration, ideogram to facsimile, the contemplative intuition of the body to a scientific analysis of its component parts.</p><p>New ways of seeing the body produce new ways of experiencing the body. Because technology allows us to penetrate that once secret enclosure of the womb, the image of the fetus, exposed to public gaze, has eclipsed that of woman in the public mind. Society, anxious about the health of the global environment, has focused on protecting &#x201c;life&#x201d; in the maternal ecosystem, in effect, pitting fetus against mother.</p><p>Duden&#x2019;s reading of the body lends a unique historical and philosophical perspective to contemporary debate over fetal rights, reproductive technologies, abortion, and the right to privacy. This provocative work should reinvigorate that debate by calling into question contemporary certainties and the policies and programs they serve to justify.</p></p><p><p>Barbara Duden has been on the faculty of the Science, Technology, and Society Program at Pennsylvania State University and is currently a Fellow at the Institute for Cultural Studies, Essen, Germany.</p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>That&#39;s the Way I See It</h2><p>Published to great critical acclaim in 1993, <i>That's the Way I See It,</i> the second volume in David Hockney's impassioned autobiography, is now available in a handsome paperback edition. Hailed by <i>Artforum</i> as "direct, engaging, and unpretentiously intelligent" and by the <i>Washington Post</i> as "the year's most engaging art book . . . quirky, opinonated and very visual," <i>That's the Way I See It</i> offers a revealing look at one of our most popular artists. In this tour de force, over 350 reproductions of Hockney's paintings, graphic designs, and experimental work are closely interwoven with the artist's insightful and highly personal narrative. Accessible, articulate, and always ahead of their time, Hockney's compostions and reflections offer a fascinationg look at a uniquely talented artist.</p><p>David Hockney lives in Los Angeles.How the act of visual representation affects what we see--a theme of Hockney's paintings--is a major concern of this lively, unpretentious memoir edited by his friend Stango, who is an editor at the Thames and Hudson publishing house. Picking up where he left off in David Hockney by David Hockney (1976), the English-born artist, who moved to California in 1978, explains how he escaped "the trap of naturalism" under the combined influence of Picasso, two years in Paris (1973-75) and encounters with Islamic art in Egypt. He muses on love, imagination and aging, writes movingly of his loss of hearing and of his father's death, and discusses his opera set designs for Tristan and Isolde and The Magic Flute. Dozens of previously unpublished paintings and drawings are closely interwoven with the narrative. Among them are Hockney's most recent works--majestic views of the Pacific coast, room interiors, still lifes and his intriguing experiments with pictures made via personal computer, color laser printer or fax machine. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Scapegoat (The Beulah Quintet, Book IV)(The Mary Lee Settle Collection Series)</h2><p>In a novel about casual and heedless acts that often lead to unthinkable results, Mary Lee Settle traces the fall of a West Virginia town that was first made rich by coal, then corrupted and destroyed by it. Set in 1912, this fourth volume of The Beulah Quintet - Settle&#39;s unforgettable generational saga about the roots of American culture, class, and identity and the meaning of freedom - propels readers with astonishing immediacy to a fateful day in a coal miners&#39; strike in which relatives of the Beulah dynasty, only dimly aware of their blood ties, confront one another on opposing sides of the dispute. Emotions escalate to a frenzy of violence as Mother Jones, leader of the striking miners, calls for action in a community devastated by Southern resignation and by guilt associated with selling out to Eastern investors.</p><p></p><h2>Mechanism Design: Analysis and Synthesis</h2><p><p> <b> </b>This thorough and comprehensive web-enhanced edition has been updated and enhanced &#x2014; No other book has a web connection like this one!

The volume contains photos, many of them full page, of the sculpture, paintings, and drawings created by Quinn, as well as the works in his art collection. The text includes thoughts on Quinn as an actor by Tom Roberts (cultural history, Rhode Island School of Design) and a short essay on his life and lifetime interest in art by art critic Donald Kuspit (State U. of New York, Stony Brook). Photos are included of Quinn&#39;s home and studio in Bristol, Rhode Island. Not indexed. Annotation �2004 Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p><b>Donald Kuspit</b> is a professor at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. He lives in New York City. <b>Jay Parini</b>, a poet and novelist, lives in Weybridge, Vermont and is a professor at Middlebury College. <b>Tom Roberts</b> teaches cultural history at the Rhode Island School of Design and lives in Cranston, Rhode Island.As a successful actor, Anthony Quinn could easily have lived a life of mindless pleasure. This lavish record of his artistic endeavors shows he did just the opposite. Compiled largely by his second wife, Katherine, who wrote the foreword and some of the photo captions, the book shows the extensive collections Quinn built up over the years and gives an excellent overview of his own artwork. He had carvings from South Asia, a large collection of painted and carved eggs, and assorted "found" items such as giant old oxen yokes and interesting rocks or branches. Quinn was also a tireless painter and sculptor, constantly sketching while on sets or at home. Though Katherine was only with him toward the end of his career, she is clearly a knowledgeable guide to Quinn&#x2019;s world, and her insights into how he saw things are revealing. She explains, for example, why he shifted toward abstract sculpture while filming Lion of the Desert (in Libya, local law banned images of women in art). Her reminiscences are written in a conversational manner and give readers a sense of the actor&#x2019;s personality and interests, but unfortunately, few photographs receive more than a short caption. The other essays by Parini and Kuspit, which attempt to put Quinn&#x2019;s art in a broader theoretical framework, provide less insight into the man and are overly academic; most people will be much more drawn to the lovely photographs. Quinn was often typecast in Hollywood, and for many people he will always be Zorba the Greek, but this book demonstrates that he took advantage of his movies&#x2019; successes to bring even more art into the world.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Paul B. Janeczko, an award-winning poet and compiler of best-selling poetry anthologies for young people, shares his very thorough tips on the art of writing poetry. Where do you get ideas? What are simple poems to write? How do you find just the right word? What pitfalls should you watch out for? These and many other questions are answered by the author, in example poems, and through quotes from other famous poets.</p><p>Who says you can't teach someone how to write poetry? Paul B. Janeczko's thoughtful, clearly organized guide provides a terrific starting point for anyone who has ever dreamed of putting pen to paper to express a thought or feeling. Janeczko covers a range of techniques to help young poets create magic with words. In chapters titled "Getting Ready," "Starting to Write," "Writing Poems that Rhyme," "Writing Free Verse Poems," and "When Your Poem Is Finished," readers will pick up tips on keeping journals, paying attention to "sound effects," revising, understanding figurative language, and submitting poems to publishers. They'll also learn to avoid such pitfalls as assuming you'll remember a brilliant idea (write it down!), not getting hung up on neatness or spelling, and keeping in mind that lots of people try to get published--not everyone will be. Special features include writing exercises, tips from poets, and bibliographical information. There's also a checklist of good poetry books and a glossary. Janeczko's enthusiasm and skill is reflected in this enjoyable, straightforward guide. As he says, "It's all done with words. No high-tech special effects. No computer-enhanced remastered sound. No trick photography. Words. Those things we've used since we were babies. And when you sit down to write a poem, you have the power of the words at your fingertips."

The next step is to start writing some simple poems to get used to the sounds words make when they are put together. . . . Finally, writers are encouraged to move on to more advanced forms of free verse . . . Interspersed throughout the text are tips from well-known poets, numerous examples, and writing exercises. Janeczko explains the writing techniques so well that young people will be tempted to pick up a pen and create some of their own work.

The book gives directions on how to write at least seven types of poems . . . He also gives excellent ideas to spur creative thinking and on keeping a journal and a workbook . . . This book is intended to be an introduction to poetry writing, and it does that very well . . . Even if a person is not interested in poetry, this book is a good introduction to its mechanics."<br>&#x2013;Melissa Thacket<br><br>Sunday Advocate (Baton Rouge, LA), March 28, 1999:<br>"Janeczko covers the basics of conceiving an idea for a poem, choosing a form, trying out rhyme schemes or free verse and revising poems . . . This is a nice book to help [young writers] get started. Parents may be invited to help -- or they may not. . . . One terrific point Janeczko makes is 'don't forget that you cannot be a good writer -- poet or prose writer -- if you are not a good reader.' At the back of the book he includes a good checklist of poetry books that young readers will enjoy. . . . This book is aimed at students from about fifth grade to eighth grade but will be useful to students on into high school."<br>&#x2013;Greg Langley<br><br>Horn Book Guide, September 1, 1999:<br>"Poet and anthologist Janeczko writes a friendly, accesible, and highly usable primer.

Howard)</h2><p>Robert E. Howard turned to writing comic and dialect Western tales only late in his career, but he found an immediate and continuously successful market for them, and they are in many respects his most accomplished and polished works. The sixteen tales collected here are some of the best of his stories, featuring Breckinridge Elkins, Pike Bearfield, and Buckner J. Grimes&#x2014;three inimitable characters who lead well-intentioned lives of perpetual confusion, mischance, and outright catastrophe. Fifteen of the stories were published between 1934 and 1937 in <i>Action Stories</i>, <i>Argosy</i>, or <i>Cowboy Stories</i>; the other remained unpublished for more than thirty years. Many of these stories were rewritten for book publication and have never been reprinted in their original form. They are reminiscent of traditional southwestern tall tales, told in dialect, featuring larger-than-life characters, swift action, broad satire, and wry humor.</p><p>Robert E. Howard (1906&#x2013;36) lived and wrote in Cross Plains, Texas. From 1924 until his death, he sold hundreds of stories to pulp-fiction magazines such as Weird Tales, Argosy, Action Stories, Fight Stories, and Cowboy Stories. As a twentieth-century American master of fantastic adventure, he rivals Edgar Rice Burroughs. David Gentzel is a noted Howard scholar and collector, specializing in the humorous Western stories. He is the editor of <i>Busted Ribs and Broken English</i> and a textual consultant for the Wandering Star editions."The University of Nebraska Press collections are an important contribution to anyone interested in Robert E. Howard, or just how good pulp fiction can be."&#x2014;<i>Southwest BookViews</i> (<i>Southwest BookViews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;An entertaining selection of Western tales, many of which were originally published between 1934 and 1937, features such inimitable characters as Breckinridge Elkins, Pike Bearfield, and Buckner J.

Here, in this concise and inviting volume, he reformulates the definition of romanticism and provides a fresh account of the immense achievements of romantic writers and artists in all media.<br> &nbsp;<br> Gay&#x2019;s scope is wide, his insights sharp. He takes on the recurring questions about how to interpret romantic figures and their works. Who qualifies to be a romantic? What ties together romantic figures who practice in different countries, employ different media, even live in different centuries? How is modernism indebted to romanticism, if at all?<br> &nbsp;<br> Guiding readers through the history of the romantic movement across Britain, France, Germany, and Switzerland, Gay argues that the best way to conceptualize romanticism is to accept its complicated nature and acknowledge that there is no &#x201c;single basket&#x201d; to contain it. Gay conceives of romantics in &#x201c;families,&#x201d; whose individual members share fundamental values but retain unique qualities. He concludes by demonstrating that romanticism extends well into the twentieth century, where its deep and lasting impact may be measured in the work of writers such as T. S. Eliot and Virginia Woolf.</p><p><b>Peter Gay</b> is Sterling Professor of History Emeritus, Yale University, and former director of the New York Public Library Center for Scholars and Writers.

The seventh edition clearly explains how to meet performance goals and current code requirements in the most cost effective manner possible. The 1991 Department of Transportation standards for cargo tanks--which can now be built and repaired only by ASME certified manufacturers--are reported and interpreted. Procedures for becoming ASME certified are also described. This clear, straightforward guide illustrates how the code applies to each vessel component, and includes tables for calculating allowable internal pressures. Procedures for complying with ASME standards are spelled out on safety procedures for design and maintenance; inspection and quality control; welding procedures and tests; operator qualifications; non-destructive testing; fabrication and installation; and requirements for pressure vessels used in nuclear power plants.</p><p>Robert Chuse graduated from the Pennsylvania State Nautical School and served as an engineering officer in the Merchant Marine.

He was the first person to have served as the president of both the Foreign Policy Analysis and the International Communication research sections in the International Studies Association. He has also served as the Editor-in-Chief of International Studies Perspectives and Foreign Policy Analysis and has conducted extensive research on media systems and information flows in international politics. He created the press freedom data set that precedes this study, to examine the effect of media freedom on international conflict, as exemplified by &#34;Press Freedom and the Democratic Peace&#34; (Journal of Peace Research). That initial analysis was expanded to complete Press Freedom and Global Politics (Praeger), which provides the foundation for the extension conducted here. Studies of popular media and political theory led to the undergraduate textbook, A Novel Approach to Politics, which is now in its 4th edition. Also, before returning to the analysis of media freedom with this project, he conducted a series of studies examining the relationship between information flows, disasters, and foreign aid, including Media, Bureaucracies and Foreign Aid (Palgrave: With Potter and Rioux).&#34;Van Belle&#39;s book is easily accessible to college freshman and sophomores.

What biological purpose does it serve? And why do we value it so highly? In <i>Soul Dust</i>, the psychologist Nicholas Humphrey, a leading figure in consciousness research, proposes a startling new theory. Consciousness, he argues, is nothing less than a magical-mystery show that we stage for ourselves inside our own heads. This self-made show lights up the world for us and makes us feel special and transcendent. Thus consciousness paves the way for spirituality, and allows us, as human beings, to reap the rewards, and anxieties, of living in what Humphrey calls the "soul niche.?</p><br><p> Tightly argued, intellectually gripping, and a joy to read, <i>Soul Dust</i> provides answers to the deepest questions. It shows how the problem of consciousness merges with questions that obsess us all--how life should be lived and the fear of death. Resting firmly on neuroscience and evolutionary theory, and drawing a wealth of insights from philosophy and literature, <i>Soul Dust</i> is an uncompromising yet life-affirming work--one that never loses sight of the majesty and wonder of consciousness.</p></p><p><p>"Just as fairy dust sprinkled on the mundane world turns it to gold, soul dust converts animal flesh into the enchanted world of sensation and self-consciousness. The result is illusion, but the illusion in which we live. This challenging and original book combines scientific rigor and exquisite sensitivity to the thoughts of philosophers, poets, writers, religious thinkers, and humanists. A delightful and thought-provoking tour de force."<b>--Simon Blackburn, author of <i>Think: A Compelling Introduction to Philosophy</i></b></p><p>"As protean as consciousness itself, Nicholas Humphrey culls from neuroscience, evolutionary biology, psychology, anthropology, philosophy, and poetry to create a spirited and impassioned intellectual adventure."<b>--Rebecca Newberger Goldstein, author of <i>36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction</i></b></p><p>"Humphrey, a theoretical psychologist at the top of his game, combines the romantic spirit of a Shelley or Keats with the razor-sharp intellect of a Sherlock Holmes. Here he brings his incisive mind to bear on one of the great riddles of science--the evolutionary origin of consciousness--and presents the best-yet solution to the supposedly insuperable problem."<b>--V. S. Ramachandran, author of <i>The Tell-Tale Brain: A Neuroscientist's Quest for What Makes Us Human</i></b></p><p>"Scientists sometimes stand accused of missing the magic as they reduce nature to explanations. In this surprising and poetic book, Nicholas Humphrey does the opposite: he delves into the brain and discovers that the magic is the whole point of consciousness."<b>--Matt Ridley, author of <i>The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature</i></b></p><p>"<i>Soul Dust</i> is a must-read for everyone who wonders about the mystery of consciousness. Humphrey has come as close as any scientist ever has to solving the 'hard problem.'"<b>--Arien Mack, New School for Social Research</b></p><p>"Nicholas Humphrey is a gifted scientific humanist who is able to integrate an extraordinary range of work from cognitive neuroscience, literature, and philosophy in offering his answer to the questions of what consciousness is, why it was selected for, and how it both causes and solves the problems of the meaning of life.

While the book is theoretically directed, it is also a down-to-earth practical book that contains ample examples, conflict dialogues, and critical incidents. Managing Intercultural Conflict Effectively helps to illustrate the complexity of intercultural conflict interactions and readers will gain a broad yet integrative perspective in assessing intercultural conflict situations. The book is a multidisciplinary text that draws from the research work of a variety of disciplines such as cross-cultural psychology, social psychology, sociology, marital and family studies, international management, and communication. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stella Ting-Toomey</strong> (PhD, University of Washington) is a professor of human communication at California State University, Fullerton (CSUF). She has published numerous books and over more than 100 articles/chapters on the topics of intercultural conflict competence and ethnic identity negotiation process. A recent book title is <em>Understanding Intercultural Communication, Second Edition</em> (with Leeva Chung; Oxford University Press). Her publications have also appeared in the <em>International Journal of Intercultural Relations</em>, <em>Communication Monographs</em>, <em>Human Communication Research</em>, and <em>The International Journal of Conflict Management</em>, among others. Dr. Ting-Toomey&#x2019;s teaching passions include intercultural conflict theory and practice and intercultural communication training. She is the 2008 recipient of the 23-campus wide CSU Wang Family Excellence Award, and the 2007&#x2013;2008 recipient of the CSU-Fullerton Outstanding Professor Award. She has lectured widely throughout the United States, Asia, and Europe on the theme of mindful intercultural conflict competence."The authors of this book bring intercultural research and theory together and develop a practical framework for understanding intercultural conflict, leading to some very specific suggestions for how we can deal with it more effectively. Whereas most literature in this area focuses on a specific context, e.g. within the family, within business organizations, or within small groups, this book spans all these contexts.

Drawn to Argenteuil in search of new inspiration, Claude Monet settled there in 1871. The beauty of the town and its proximity to Paris, along with the amiable presence of Monet himself, soon attracted other artists who found there the inspiration to create some of the most lyrical, dazzling, and progressive paintings of the day. This richly illustrated book explores the responses to Argenteuil of six influential painters in more than fifty of their works.<br><br>With scenic vistas still unmarred by urban industrialization, Argenteuil in the 1870s was ideally suited to the experiments in plein-air effects that became the hallmark of classic impressionist works. Paul Hayes Tucker describes the lively artistic exchange that developed among Monet, Eug�ne Boudin, Gustave Caillebotte, �douard Manet, Auguste Renoir, and Alfred Sisley as they worked, often side by side, in and around the town. At Argenteuil, Tucker shows, the artists&#x2019; fascination with atmospheric effects, depictions of modern life, and dialogue with one another coalesced to produce a unique and revolutionary body of work.<br><br></p><p><b>Paul Hayes Tucker</b> is professor of art at the University of Massachusetts, Boston.

Examining First, Fourth, Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights as they pertain to these encounters, it explains how public administrators must do their jobs and how administrative systems must operate in order to comply with constitutional law.</p> <p><strong><em>Explores the conflicts between laws</em></strong></p> <p></p> <p>The book begins by presenting a historical account of the way constitutional and administrative law have incrementally "retrofitted" public agencies into the nation&#x2019;s constitutional design. It examines the federal judiciary&#x2019;s impact on federal administration and the effect of the nation&#x2019;s myriad environmental laws on public administration. Next, it focuses on the role of the individual as a client and customer of public agencies. In a discussion of the Fourth Amendment, it examines street-level encounters between citizens and law enforcement agents. Responding to the rise of the new public management (NPM), it also adds, for the first time in this edition, a chapter that analyzes the rights of the individual not only as a government employee but also as a government contractor.</p> <p><strong><em>Enhanced with numerous references</em></strong></p> <p></p> <p>The final chapters of the book address issues concerning the rights of inmates in administrative institutions and balancing the need to protect individual rights with the ability of agencies to function effectively.

The result is a window into everyday life and culture in a rapidly growing United States, with entries representing every region, linguistic heritage, and field of interest:</p> <ul> <li>New England: funkify, plaguy sight, kedge</li> <li>The South: marooning, catawamptiously chawed up</li> <li>New York: clockmutch, rullichies, soap-lock</li> <li>The West: scrouger, prairie bitters, I dad!</li> <li>Spanish: sangaree, chaparral, vamos</li> <li>Native American languages: netop, sagamore, supawn</li> <li>Politics: slang-whanging, Dough-Faces, to row up Salt river</li> <li>Business: wild cat bank, corner, Peter Funk</li> </ul> <p>Filled with amusing anecdotes, editorial asides, and some surprisingly modern slang, this facsimile of the book&#x2019;s first edition is a great rediscovery for a new generation of readers and a fascinating snapshot of life in the early decades of the United States of America.</p></p><p>"BLUE STOCKING. A ridiculous epithet applied here as well as in England to literary ladies, and borrowed from that gallant nation the French. Called also simply a blue. . . . <p>"OLYCOKE. (Dutch, olikoek, oil-cake.) A cake fried in lard. A favorite delicacy with the Dutch, and also with their descendants, in New York. There are various kinds, as dough-nuts, crullers, etc. . . .</p> <p>"TO SEE THE ELEPHANT is a South-western phrase, and means, generally, to undergo any disappointment of high-raised expectations. . . . For instance, men who have volunteered for the Mexican war, expecting to reap lots of glory and enjoyment, but instead have found only sickness, fatigue, privations, and suffering, are currently said to have &#x2018;seen the elephant.&#x2019;"</p> <p>In 1848, these definitions&#x2013;along with several thousand others&#x2013;made their appearance in a revolutionary new lexicon of American slang: John Russell Bartlett&#x2019;s now-classic Dictionary of Americanisms. A Rhode Island bookseller, politician, ethnographer, and all-around Yankee Renaissance man, Bartlett spent ten years on his Dictionary, compiling New England colloquialisms (to shoot one&#x2019;s grandmother), borrowings from Native American languages (samp), Southernisms (huckleberry above the persimmon), political and business terms (Barnburners, bull and bear), New York Dutch words (smear-case), and new additions from the expanding Western frontier (to bark off squirrels, ranchero). The result is a glimpse into everyday life and language from the early decades of the republic, a dozen years before the Civil War.</p> <p>Published to rave reviews, Bartlett&#x2019;s book went through four editions, becoming a standard reference work in nineteenth-century America. Now with a new Foreword by bestselling word guru Richard Lederer, this facsimile edition of the 1848 original presents this classic piece of Americana&#x2013;long out of print&#x2013;to a new generation of history buffs and language mavens alike.</p> <p>As Richard Lederer puts it, "the story of language in America is the story of our Declaration of Linguistic Independence, the separating from its parent of that glorious, uproarious, tremendous, stupendous, end-over-endous adventure we call American English." The Dictionary of Americanisms is a highly readable testament to that independence, and Bartlett&#x2019;s anecdotes, quotes, and idiosyncratic definitions make for irresistible browsing. (Take a look at his entries for acknowledge the corn, Loco-foco, and Brother Jonathan, or the list of exotic nineteenth-century cocktails under liquor.) For anyone interested in America&#x2019;s history, culture, or language, John Russell Bartlett&#x2019;s Dictionary of Americanisms is a remarkable rediscovery of a forgotten classic.</p>A native of Providence, Rhode Island, JOHN RUSSELL BARTLETT (1805&#x2014;1886) was a bookseller, politician, ethnographer, draftsman, and linguist. He helped found the American Ethnological Society and was part of a government team that surveyed America&#x2019;s new Southwestern borders after the Mexican War. Between 1848 and 1877, he published four editions of the Dictionary of Americanisms.<br> RICHARD LEDERER (Foreword) is the author of more than 3,000 books and articles about language and humor, including his bestselling Anguished English series. Dr. Lederer&#x2019;s syndicated column, "Looking at Language," appears in news-papers and magazines throughout the United States. He hosts a weekly show, A Way With Words, on San Diego Public Radio.

However, unlike other major sciences, its theoretical foundations are rarely articulated. While the idea of epidemiologic theory may seem dry and arcane, it is at its core about explaining the people's health. It is about life and death. It is about biology and society. It is about ecology and the economy. It is about how myriad aspects of people's lives - involving work, dignity, desire, love, play, conflict, discrimination, and injustice - become literally incorporated into our bodies and manifest in our health status, individually and collectively. And it is about essential knowledge critical for improving the people's health and minimizing inequitable burdens of disease, disability, and death.<br><br>Woven from a vast array of schools of thought, including those in the natural, social, and biomedical sciences, epidemiologic theory is a rich tapestry whose time for analysis is long overdue. By tracing its history and contours from ancient societies on through the development of - and debates within - contemporary epidemiology worldwide, Dr. Krieger shows how epidemiologic theory has long shaped epidemiologic practice, knowledge, and the politics of public health. Outlining an ecosocial theory of disease distribution that situates both population health and epidemiologic theory in societal and ecologic context, she offers a more holistic picture of how we embody the human experience. <br> <br>This concise, conceptually rich, and accessible book is a rallying cry for a return to the study and discussion of epidemiologic theory: what it is, why it matters, how it has changed over time, and its implications for improving population health and promoting health equity. It should be required reading for all epidemiologists, or anyone involved in the study of human health and well-being.<br></p><p><br><strong>Nancy Krieger, Ph.D.,</strong> is Professor of Society, Human Development, and Health at the Harvard School of Public Health<br><br>"Practitioners and users of epidemiology need a thorough grounding in both theory and methods of the discipline. Whilst many books address the latter, until Nancy Krieger's groundbreaking work there was no sustained presentation of epidemiological theory that could be recommended to students and seasoned practitioners alike. This book will become a landmark in advancing the field. It reminds us that why we do epidemiology is as important to understand as how to do it." --George Davey Smith, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology, University of Bristol; Co-Editor, <em>International Journal of</em> <em>Epidemiology</em> <br> <br><p></p><br>"With erudition and passion, Krieger has produced the first comprehensive assessment of epidemiological theories concerning the major drivers of group differences in health by race, class, and place. She lays bare the sociology of epidemiological knowledge and leaves no doubt that epidemiological theories, for good or ill, can have powerful consequences for the people's health." --Sherman James, Susan B. King Professor of Public Policy, Duke University <br><p></p><br>"In <em>Epidemiology and the People's Health</em>, Nancy Krieger confronts the challenges that face epidemiology in the 21st century. 'How does epidemiology help to improve health?' Her response tackles how poor health tracks along social divides, and then she asks: 'why?' Perhaps a simple question, but in answering Krieger leads us across centuries and continents with a rigor that I can only describe as fearless. The result is sweeping in scope, both scholarly and succinct, detailed and synthetic, moving from complex concepts to concrete examples with depth, clarity and wit." --Mary Bassett, African Health Initiative, Doris Duke Charitable Foundation; former Deputy Commissioner, New York City Health Department <br><p></p><br>"Without a doubt, Nancy Krieger is the most brilliant social epidemiologist of her generation. In this masterful volume, she displays a colossal breadth and depth of knowledge of historical and contemporary epidemiological theories in context, their scientific, social, and political roots and their implications. Writing fluently, passionately, and authoritatively, Krieger shows the connections, past and present, among epidemiologic theory, methodology, practice, and, ultimately, the people's health. Not only does Krieger study epidemiological theory, she seeks to change it-with her highly original and well-grounded ecosocial approach that integrates biological, social, and political processes.... Every epidemiology and public health student, professor, and practitioner should read and reread this book." --Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Professor and Canada Research Chair in International Health, University of Toronto; Editor, Textbook of International Health: Global Health in a Dynamic World<p></p><br>"From miasma to contagion, germ to gene, Krieger artfully traces the history and debates surrounding diverse epidemiologic theories, unearthing a buried theoretical past. In so doing, Krieger enlightens current public health science. Specifically, she gives an unflinching account of the historically and culturally situated biases that have become entrenched in epidemiologic theories-supporting her central tenet that we cannot fully understand the distribution of health and disease in human populations without examining cultural, social and historical context. This book is not only informative, it is transformative-providing the historical foundation needed to re-imagine and recreate contemporary population health approaches that fully promote health equity." --Karina L. Walters, William P. and Ruth Gerberding Endowed University Professor and Director, Indigenous Wellness Research Institute, University of Washington School of Social Work <br><p></p><br>"(Krieger) has written a large, well-structured, critically argued and exhaustively referenced book, the culmination of two decades of her wrestling with and writing about the fundamental questions: Does epidemiologic theory exist; if not, should it exist; and what form should <br>it take?" <em>International Journal of Epidemiology</em><p></p><br>"In this dense but highly readable volume suitable for health practitioners and public health students at any level, Krieger moves from the basic question, Does epidemiologic theory exist? (chapter 1) to examine historical examples (chapters 2), outline mainstream and alternative theories (chapters 5), present her ecosocial theory of disease distribution <br>(chapter 7), and demonstrate how theory counts and references are woven within the narrative." -- <em>Health and Human Rights</em><p></p><br>"...dense and highly readable...."--Susan R. Holman, Health and Human Right Journal<p></p><br>"Ultimately, <em>Epidemiology and the People's Health</em> is required reading for epidemiologists interested in the evolution and emergence of theory in the field. We would argue that all epidemiologists should be so interested... this book firmly establishes the importance of theory in epidemiology. We look forward to reading the many works it will inspire." -- <em>American Journal of Epidemilogy</em><p></p><br>"Krieger's arguments are detailed and cogent" -- <em>Annals of Epidemiology</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>I&#39;m Dr. Red Duke</h2><p>James Henry &#x201c;Red&#x201d; Duke Jr., MD, was an icon of twentieth-century medicine, a pioneer and visionary, and a lifelong son of Texas who, far from forgetting his roots, reveled in them. Bryant Boutwell&#x2019;s entertaining and meticulously researched biography of Red Duke, based on years of interviews with Duke and his family, friends, and colleagues as well as painstaking exploration of both public archives and personal papers and effects, not only pays tribute to a great surgeon and his influence but also crafts a detailed and intimate portrait of the man behind the larger-than-life television image.<br><br> Not only did Duke found the Life Flight air ambulance service that helped place Memorial Hermann Hospital and the Texas Medical Center at the forefront of the nation&#x2019;s trauma units, he also advanced the use of media communications for reaching the public with both common-sense and cutting-edge health information.

Through a series of interviews with Duke&#x2019;s family, friends, colleagues and patients, he has brought Dr. &#x2018;Red&#x2019; Duke back to life and completed a book that will serve not only as a memorial to the iconic Texas doctor, but as a testimony of what the practice of medicine should be.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Texana Reads</i> (<i>Texana Reads</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;a focused and balanced look at one of the 20th century&#x2019;s most extraordinary and talented surgeons.

This provocative work opens a window onto the complex motivations and experiences of the people behind the stereotypes and misconceptions that have exploded along with the practice of transnational courtship and marriage. Combining extensive Internet ethnography and face-to-face fieldwork, <i>Romance on a Global Stage </i>looks at the intimate realities of Filipinas, Chinese women, and U.S. men corresponding in hopes of finding a suitable marriage partner. <br><br>Through the experiences of those engaged in pen pal relationships&#x2015;their stories of love, romance, migration, and long-distance dating&#x2015;this book conveys the richness and dignity of women's and men's choices without reducing these correspondents to calculating opportunists or naive romantics. Attentive to the structural, cultural, and personal factors that prompt women and men to seek marriage partners abroad, <i>Romance on a Global Stage </i>questions the dichotomies so frequently drawn between structure and agency, and between global and local levels of analysis.</p><p>"Nicole Constable has produced a splendid sequel to her much-praised <i>Maid to Order in Hong Kong.</i> Constable's sensitive ethnography and her international scope insures that we see every Filipino and Chinese woman as a thinking, feeling person, and every American man who is her pen pal and sometimes future husband as far more than a mere cartoon character. <i>Romance on a Global Stage</i> wonderfully complicates the genderings and globalizings of power and emotions."&#x2015;Cynthia Enloe, author of <i>Bananas, Beaches and Bases</i> <br><br>"The rise of feminism in North America has been paralleled by a growth in marriages between Western men and women from the global periphery. Constable's fascinating study explores the multiple desires at work, revealing the anti-feminist reason and feminist surprises in these global romances."&#x2015;Aihwa Ong, author of <i>Buddha Is Hiding: Refugees, Citizenship, the New America</i><br><br>"Constable adds a new map to the cartographies of desire in this nuanced and fresh account of 'mail-order marriage.' Her original work carefully attends to emotion, sex, and political economy, offering a complex account of gender, marriage, and globalization."&#x2015;Carole S. Vance, author of <i>Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality</i><br><br>"This innovative and compassionate work maps new formations of desire in the context of globalization. Constable breaks through the stereotypes about transnational pen-pal marriages to enable us to see, in an ethnographically detailed way, how agency and desire are shaped by uneven economic development and how cyber-technologies figure in the production of new global imaginaries."&#x2015;Ann Anagnost, author of <i>National Past-times: Narrative, Representation, and Power in Modern China</i><br><br>"Constable is a talented and perceptive anthropologist who has mastered the use of the web both as a research tool and a topic of research.

The theory is grounded in known facts about human functioning and about the human species as part of life on Earth.</p> <p>Bowen family systems theory is comprised of eight concepts. Each concept has been added only after its factual basis has been established. The theory postulated that the human family is a multigenerational, natural, living system and that the emotional functioning of each member of the system affects the functioning of the other members in predictable ways.</p> <p>An emotion is the automatic response of an organism to its environment, including others with whom the organism is in relationship. A natural, living system is one that is shaped by the selective forces of nature which affect whether and how the system survives from generation to generation. Each member of a natural, living system responds to these selective forces in basic, fundamental ways; that is, in emotional ways. Emotions may be transmitted between and among individuals who are members of the system and it is through this emotional process that each member of a natural living system may affect the functioning of other members of the system.</p></p><p></p><h2>Timer/Generator Circuits Manual</h2><p>This text is concerned with waveform generator techniques and circuits.

A great deal of research has focused on the pre- and early history of cinema, but there has been little speculation about a future cinema incorporating new electronic media. Electronic media have not only fundamentally transformed cinema but have altered its role as a witness to reality by rendering "realities" not necessarily linked to documentation, by engineering environments that incorporate audiences as participants, and by creating event-worlds that mix realities and narratives in forms not possible in traditional cinema. This hybrid cinema melds montage, traditional cinema, experimental literature, television, video, and the net. The new cinematic forms suggest that traditional cinema no longer has the capacity to represent events that are themselves complex configurations of experience, interpretation, and interaction.<br> <br> This book, which accompanies an exhibition organized by the ZKM Institute for Visual Media, explores the history and significance of pre-cinema and of early experimental cinema, as well as the development of the unique theaters in which "immersion" evolved. Drawing on a broad range of scholarship, it examines the shift from monolithic Hollywood spectacles to works probing the possibilities of interactive, performative, and net-based cinemas. The post-cinematic condition, the book shows, has long roots in artistic practice and influences every channel of communication.</p><p>Jeffrey Shaw is Director of the Institute for Visual Media at the ZKM Center for Art and Media, Karlsruhe."The editors offer a comprehensive look at the evolution of cinema."<br> &#x2014; <i>The Futurist</i><br><br>"...a well-packaged overview of the history and current scope of digital art, particularly of the interactive kind."<br> &#x2014; <b>Michael Rush</b></p><h2>CompTIA A+ 220-901 and 220-902 Exam Cram</h2><p>This is the perfect study guide to help you pass CompTIA�&#x2019;s new A+� 220-901 and 220-902 exams.

In that time there have been groundbreaking civilian aircraft, such as flying boats, the first pressurized cabin aircraft, jet and supersonic aircraft, as well as immense changes in the capacity of a typical airliner: in the 1920s aircraft struggled to carry 20 passengers, today some models can carry up to 800 people. The book includes many types, from cargo transports and freighters, through flying boats, passenger airliners, business jets and supersonic carriers. Featured aircraft include: the Ford Trimotor &#x2018;Tin Goose&#x2019;, one of the great workhorses of early aviation history; the first post-war intercontinental airliners, such as the Douglas DC-4 Skymaster, De Havilland Comet and Boeing 377 Stratocruiser; the Vickers VC10, one of the greats of the 1960s golden age of commercial airliners, when jet-powered air commerce was new and airliners pampered passengers; the massive Super Guppy heavy transport, one of the widest aircraft in aviation history; the supersonic Tupolev Tu-144 &#x2018;Charger&#x2019; and Concorde, Cold War competitors in aviation excellence; the Embraer ERJ, part of a new range of narrow-bodied airliners; and the most popular passenger aircraft of the present, including the Boeing 747 and Airbus A320. Each entry includes a brief description of the model&#x2019;s development and history, a profile view, key features and specifications.

This brief, practical introduction to literary theory explores core theories in a unique chronological format and includes an anthology of relevant fiction, poetry, and nonfiction to help bring those theories to life. Remarkably readable and engaging, the text makes even complex concepts manageable for those beginning to think about literary theory, and example analyses for each type of criticism show how real students have applied the theories to works included in the anthology. Now updated with the latest scholarship, including a full discussion of Ecocriticism and increased emphasis on American multicultural approaches, THEORY INTO PRACTICE provides an essential foundation for thoughtful and effective literary analysis.</p><p>Ann B.

Two new justices have joined the high court, more than 800 cases have been decided, and a good deal of new scholarship has appeared on many of the topics treated in the <em>Companion</em>. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist presided over the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, and the Court as a whole played a decisive and controversial role in the outcome of the 2000 presidential election. Under Rehnquists's leadership, a bare majority of the justices have rewritten significant areas of the law dealing with federalism, sovereign immunity, and the commerce power.<br><br>This new edition includes new entries on key cases and fully updated treatment of crucial areas of constitutional law, such as abortion, freedom of religion, school desegregation, freedom of speech, voting rights, military tribunals, and the rights of the accused. These developments make the second edition of this accessible and authoritative guide essential for judges, lawyers, academics, journalists, and anyone interested in the impact of the Court's decisions on American society.<br></p><p>In Democracy in America, de Tocqueville observed that there is hardly a political question in the United States which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one. Two hundred years of American history have certainly born out the truth of this remark. Whether a controversy is political, economic, or social, whether it focuses on child labor, prayer in public schools, war powers, busing, abortion, business monopolies, or capital punishment, eventually the battle is taken to court. And the ultimate venue for these vital struggles is the Supreme Court. Indeed, the Supreme Court is a prism through which the entire life of our nation is magnified and illuminated, and through which we have defined ourselves as a people. Now, in The Oxford Companion to the Supreme Court of the United States, readers have a rich source of information about one of the central institutions of American life. Everything one would want to know about the Supreme Court is here, in more than a thousand alphabetically arranged entries. There are biographies of every justice who ever sat on the Supreme Court (with pictures of each) as well as entries on rejected nominees and prominent judges (such as Learned Hand), on presidents who had an important impact on - or conflict with - the Court (including Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Franklin Delano Roosevelt), and on other influential figures (from Alexander Hamilton to Cass Gilbert, the architect of the Supreme Court Building). More than four hundred entries examine every major case that the court has decided, from Marbury v. Madison (which established the Court&#39;s power to declare federal laws unconstitutional) and Scott v. Sandford (the Dred Scott Case) toBrown v. Board of Education and Roe v. Wade. In addition, there are extended essays on the major issues that have confronted the Court (from slavery to national security, capital punishment to religion, affirmative action to the Vietnam War), entries on judicial matters and legal terms (ranging from judicial review and separation of powers to amicus brief and habeas corpus), articles on all Amendments to the Constitution, and an extensive, four-part history of the Court. And as in all Oxford Companions, the contributions combine scholarship with engaging insight, giving us a sense of the personality and the inner workings of the Court. They examine everything from the wanderings of the Supreme Court (the first session was held in the Royal Exchange Building in New York City, and the Court at times has met in a Congressional committee room, a tavern, a rented house, and finally, in 1935, its own building), to the Jackson-Black feud and the clouded resignation of Abe Fortas, to the Supreme Court&#39;s press room and the paintings and sculptures adorning the Supreme Court building. The decisions of the Supreme Court have touched - and will continue to influence - every corner of American society. A comprehensive, authoritative guide to the Supreme Court, this volume is an essential reference source for everyone interested in the workings of this vital institution and in the multitude of issues it has confronted over the course of its history.<br><strong>Kermit L.

Kastan examines the motives and activities of Shakespeare&#39;s first publishers; the curious eighteenth-century schizophrenia that saw Shakespeare radically modified on stage at the very moment that scholars were working to establish and restore the &#34;genuine&#34; texts, and the exhilarating possibilities of electronic media for presenting Shakespeare now to new generations of readers. This is an important contribution to Shakespearean textual scholarship, to the history of the early English book trade, and to the theory of drama itself.</p><p>This is a lively and learned account of Shakespeare&#39;s plays as they were transformed from scripts to be performed into books to be read, and eventually from popular entertainments into the centerpieces of the English literary canon.

Here, two books especially come to mind: Steven Weinberg&#39;s The First Three Minutes, written 12 years ago, and the recent best-seller ABriefHistory of Time by Stephen Hawking. The two books are complementary. Weinberg-Nobel prize winner/physicist-wrote from the standpoint of an elementary particle physicist with emphasis on the contents of the universe, whereas Hawking wrote more as a general relativist with emphasis on gravity and the geometry of the universe. Neither one, however, presented the complete story. Weinberg did not 13 venture back beyond the time when temperature was higher than 10 K and 32 perhaps as high as 10 K. He gave no explanation for the origin of particles and the singularity or source of the overwhelming radiation energy in our uni verse of one billion photons for each proton. Hawking presents a uni verse that has no boundaries, was not created, and will not be destroyed. The object of this book is to describe my new theory on the creation of our uni verse in a multi-universe cosmos. The new cosmological model eliminates the troublesome singularity-big bang theory and explains for the first time the origin of matter and the overwhelming electromagnetic radiation contained in the universe. My new theory also predicted the existence ofhigh-energy gamma rays, which were recendy detected in powerful bursts.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Psychoanalysis of the Schizophrenic Patient: Theory of the Technique</h2><p>What Freud called the &#34;stone wall&#34; was first breached by this pioneering psychiatrist and psychoanalyst with this seminal work in 1969.

The primary emphasis of the book is on methods for interpreting MANOVA statistical analyses. These are illustrated through the use of two numerical examples: one involves a small, hypothetical data set, which can be analyzed by the reader with minimal effort; the other involves real data and shows how MANOVA can be used in actual research. MANOVA represents a logical extension of <b>Analysis of Variance </b>by Iversen and Norpoth (QASS 1). </p></p><p></p><h2>A Game at Chess: Thomas Middleton (The Revels Plays)</h2><p>For many years Middleton&#39;s &#34;A Game at Chess&#34; was more notorious than read, considered rather a phenomenon of theatrical history than a pre-eminent piece of dramatic writing. &#34;A Game at Chess&#34; was a nine days&#39; wonder, an exceptional play of King James&#39; reign on account of its unprecedented representation of matters of state usually forbidden on the stage. The King&#39;s Men performed the play uninterruptedly between 5th and 14th August, 1624 at their Globe Theatre, attracting large audiences, before the Privy Council closed the theatre by the King&#39;s command. More recently, growing interest in the connections of economics and politics with authorship have promoted readings that locate the play so firmly within its historical context as propaganda that, again, its worthwhile literary and theatrical qualities are neglected. In writing &#34;A Game at Chess&#34;, Middleton employed the devices of the neoclassical comedy of intrigue within the matrix of the traditional oral play. What might have seemed old-fashioned allegory was rejuvenated by his adoption of the fashionable game of chess as the fiction within which the play was set. The product of Middleton&#39;s experienced craftsmanship is at once deceptively simple and surprisingly complex.</p><p>T.H. Howard-Hill is C.

Both teams were undefeated going into the game, but the Hurricanes were heavily favored, as they had demolished each of their opponents during the regular season. On January 2, 1987, Penn State pulled off one of the most surprising upsets in college football by handing the University of Miami team its only loss of the season. In <em>The Perfect Season</em>, with help from the Penn State players involved, M. G. Missanelli retells the story not just of this championship game but also of Penn State&#x2019;s entire season.</p><p>Beginning with its Orange Bowl loss in 1985 (Penn State&#x2019;s only loss that year), Missanelli recounts the glorious 1986 season through the eyes of those Penn State athletes. The book also focuses on the media&#x2019;s buildup of the national championship, explaining why the University of Miami team was considered the villain in this battle. Numerous anecdotes stories are included, such as the incident where the University of Miami team arrived at the Fiesta Bowl wearing combat fatigues in an attempt to wage psychological war on its opponents. But such tactics appeared to have little effect the Penn State Nittany Lions, whose tenacity resulted in victory in the final minutes of the game.</p><p>Drawing on interviews as well as his own recollections, the author relates the vivid story of one of the most triumphant seasons in the history of Penn State football. Anyone interested in college football, the Nittany Lions, or Joe Paterno&#x2019;s legacy will find this book impossible to put down.</p></p><p>"It's been 20 years since that night in the Arizona desert when Penn State and Miami clashed in a battle of football and philosophy in the Fiesta Bowl. It was the last national championship for Penn State, won in dramatic fashion with a goal-line interception in the final seconds to preserve a 14-10 win. It was, in the eyes of many, the zenith of the program. And many of the players, now middle-aged fathers, remain icons in the history of the sport at Penn State. Mike Missanelli does a masterful job of recreating the game, reconnecting with the key players for both teams and rekindles fond memories of a night when no star in the college football galaxy shined brighter than Penn State's." --Ron Bracken, <i>Centre Daily Times</i> <p> "Missanelli brings to life the 1986 national football championship season, with a great account of the Nittany Lion victory over the combat fatigue-clad Miami Hurricans. The Foreword by D. J. Dozier is a delight as are various vignettes of the participants such as Jerry Sandusky, Shane Conlan, Bob White, and the unfortunate-in-life John Bruno."--Ronald A. Smith, author of <i>Big-Time Football at Harvard 1905</i> </p><p> " Jan. 2, 1987. It is at once the most profound and significant day of the nearly 15,000 Joe Paterno has spent as Penn State's football coach. On that night, in the spotlit Arizona desert, Paterno's Nittany Lions defeated Miami in a national championship matchup whose contrasts were as vivid as the personalities involved. In <i>The Perfect Season</i>, Mike Missanelli carefully dissects and recreates this memorable game, one that would serve as a perfect little morality play, a showcase for all that was right and wrong with college football." -Frank Fitzpatrick, author of <i>The Lion in Autumn</i></p><p>M.

Like some immigrants, Sevander's father, Oscar Corgan, found America a place more of injustice than of opportunity, and he edited a Finnish socialist newspaper. Sevander, aided by journalist Hertzel, recreates the idealistic fervor of that time in a candid, absorbing narrative. In 1934, when the author was 11, her family immigrated to Karelia, the Soviet republic bordering Finland, even as a disillusioned group of Americans headed home. She describes the tensions between Russians and Finns, the privations of family life, and the initial spirit of cooperation. However, when the purges began, Corgan was taken away, and his daughter's search for him continues through the book. Sevander went into internal exile with her family and was rescued by a former teacher; she joined the Red Army as a scout in World War II, but was sent to a labor camp. She eventually married and became an English teacher; her last 40 years in Russia, she reflects, have been fairly happy. Photos not seen by PW <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.Sevander was one of the thousands of Finnish Americans who emigrated in the 1930s from the Upper Midwest to the Soviet Union in order to help build the new Communist state. In Soviet Karelia, her family met hardship, betrayal, and death at the hands of Stalin's regime. The author's own commitment permitted her to survive, build a career, and join the Communist Party. As glasnost revealed the system's corruption, she finally abandoned the party but not her faith in socialism. Yet she also rediscovered her American heritage through the visit of a Midwestern delegation that knew nothing of the past emigration. Touching and tragic, this story adds to the understanding of Soviet-American and ethnic relationships. For larger and subject collections and YA reading.<br><i>- Rena Fowler, Northern Michigan Univ.

What are their inherent theoretical limitations? These are questions to which computer scientists must address themselves. The theoretical framework which enables such questions to be answered has been developed over the last fifty years from the idea of a computable function: intuitively a function whose values can be calculated in an effective or automatic way. This book is an introduction to computability theory (or recursion theory as it is traditionally known to mathematicians). Dr Cutland begins with a mathematical characterisation of computable functions using a simple idealised computer (a register machine); after some comparison with other characterisations, he develops the mathematical theory, including a full discussion of non-computability and undecidability, and the theory of recursive and recursively enumerable sets. The later chapters provide an introduction to more advanced topics such as Gildel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, degrees of unsolvability, the Recursion theorems and the theory of complexity of computation. Computability is thus a branch of mathematics which is of relevance also to computer scientists and philosophers. Mathematics students with no prior knowledge of the subject and computer science students who wish to supplement their practical expertise with some theoretical background will find this book of use and interest.</p><p>This introduction to recursive theory computability begins with a mathematical characterization of computable functions, develops the mathematical theory and includes a full discussion of noncomputability and undecidability.

The author demonstrates the enormous diversity and constant change that characterized music and musical life during this period. Downs eschews the usual stylistic labels, such as Rococo and High Classic, and instead organizes the text into short time spans. Within each, he looks to the social conditions and daily life of the musician, the aesthetics and audience preference in structures, performing combinations, and performing styles. The minor composers, or kleinmeister, are carefully observed, since they most accurately mirror their times. On the other hand, the giants, who left their mark on music for all time, receive full biographical scrutiny at each stage of their development. The book begins with the transition from the Baroque up to 1760 and the burgeoning new style that developed in the next two decades. The author then focuses on the early years of Haydn and Mozart before giving full treatment to the last twenty years of the eighteenth century, which saw the Classical style reach its apogee. Downs returns to the mature Haydn and deals with the last decade of Mozart&#39;s life, and finally considers Beethoven&#39;s musical origins and accomplishments. He concludes by documenting the eighteenth-century heritage at work in the early nineteenth century. Copiously illustrated, with abundant music examples, this fascinating survey provides invaluable insights into the period that produced some of the most astonishing music ever written.</p><h2>Earth&#39;s Oldest Rocks</h2><p><p><i>Earth&#x2019;s Oldest Rocks, Second Edition,</i> is the only single reference source for geological research of early Earth.

Well, from 1950 until the late 1970s, a huge number of people begged to differ, as they devoured Immanuel Velikovsky&#x2019;s major best-seller, Worlds in Collision, insisting that perhaps this polymathic thinker held the key to a new science and a new history. Scientists, on the other hand, assaulted Velikovsky&#x2019;s book, his followers, and his press mercilessly from the get-go. In <i>The Pseudoscience Wars</i>, Michael D. Gordin resurrects the largely forgotten figure of Velikovsky and uses his strange career and surprisingly influential writings to explore the changing definitions of the line that separates legitimate scientific inquiry from what is deemed bunk, and to show how vital this question remains to us today. Drawing on a wealth of previously unpublished material from Velikovsky&#x2019;s personal archives, Gordin presents a behind-the-scenes history of the writer&#x2019;s career, from his initial burst of success through his growing influence on the counterculture, heated public battles with such luminaries as Carl Sagan, and eventual eclipse. Along the way, he offers fascinating glimpses into the histories and effects of other fringe doctrines, including creationism, Lysenkoism, parapsychology, and more&#x2014;all of which have surprising connections to Velikovsky&#x2019;s theories.</p> <p> </p> <p>Science today is hardly universally secure, and scientists seem themselves beset by critics, denialists, and those they label &#x201c;pseudoscientists&#x201d;&#x2014;as seen all too clearly in battles over evolution and climate change. <i>The Pseudoscience Wars</i> simultaneously reveals the surprising Cold War roots of our contemporary dilemma and points readers to a different approach to drawing the line between knowledge and nonsense.</p> <br><p></p></p><p><p><b>Michael D.

(The Palliser novels of Anthony Trollope) by Trollope, Anthony (1973) Hardcover</h2><p>With sympathy and care, Trollope observes two controversial heroines in the first of his series of novels about the grand old Palliser family&nbsp;Alice Vavasor should be married to the sensible, kindly John Grey, but despite what her respectable relations might think, Alice cannot quite reconcile herself to this fate. Once upon a time she was engaged to her wild cousin George, and now he stands in need of her money and, perhaps too, her good influence. Meanwhile Alice's friend Lady Glencora has married the rising politician Plantagenet Palliser, but is still pursued by Burgo Fitzgerald, the handsome rascal she loves. In this hugely compelling novel, Trollope shows the two women struggling to reconcile heart, mind, and moral code while enduring the stifling scrutiny of their contemporaries.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841.

This beautifully detailed edition of the classic story is closely adapted from Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s original text, and it features all the characters familiar to viewers of the Disney animated film. Appropriate for both children and adults, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is distinguished by the luminous artwork of Greg Hildebrandt.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

Dostoevsky came back to the capital determined to re-establish his literary reputation to be accepted as a writer of the first rank. Spiritually transformed, he had also gained in physical vigour and self-assurance, despite the debilitating hardships of prison and army life. In this lucid study of five years, a period previously passed over rapidly, Professor Frank describes the intricate process of the novelist&#39;s self definition and the reshaping of his social-political outlook, in interaction with all the forces of the &#39;stir of liberation&#39; under Alexander II.</p><p>Joseph Frank is Professor of Comparative Literature Emeritus at Princeton University and Professor of Comparative Literature and Slavic Languages and Literature Emeritus at Stanford University. Previous volumes of Dostoevsky have received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Biography, two Christian Gauss Awards, two James Russell Lowell Awards, a Los Angeles Book prize and other honours. In addition to the previous volumes of Dostoevsky, Frank is author of Through the Russian Prism: Essays on Literature and Culture.This is the third in a projected five-volume literary biography of Dostoevsky. The first two volumes ( LJ 9/1/76; 11/15/83) have been widely acclaimed; the present volume, which covers Dostoevsky's return to Petersburg and the resumption of his literary activities following his exile in Siberia, is no less an achievement. It is to Frank's credit that he has analyzed so carefully these formative years, usually neglected by scholars, and produced this gracefully written volume of intellectual history. It is a work of vast erudition and of absorbing interest that can hardly be recommended too highly. Essential for all major collections. Joyce S.

In particular, these mediums were used to record ephemeral or performative events and to render visible conceptual systems or to question the supposed objectivity of representation itself. This volume focuses primarily on artworks from the last decade and proposes that the extensive use of reproducible mediums in today's art has its roots in an earlier formative period. By the end of the 70s, many artists turned to photography as a vehicle through which to critique photographic representation and to subvert an art system premised on the notion of the original. While this practice came to define much of the 80s postmodern art, its legacy for the 90s was essentially the license to indulge in photographic fantasy, image construction, and cinematic narrative. Artists working today freely manipulate their representations of the empirical world or invent entirely new cosmologies. They process their subject matter through conceptual systems or use digital processes to alter their images. Some directly intervene in the environment, subtly shifting components of the found world and establishing their quiet presence in it; others fabricate entire architectural environments for the camera lens. This current state of the arts and its recent history are represented via more than 150 works by 55 artists, including Nam June Paik, Kara Walker, Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Marina Abramovic, Vito Acconci, Ana Mendieta, Bruce Nauman, Robert Smithson, Christian Boltanski, Sophie Calle, Fischli &amp; Weiss, Ann Hamilton, Robert Mapplethorpe, Annette Messager, Cindy Sherman, Bernd and Hilla Becher, Elger Esser, Andreas Gursky, Candida H fer, Thomas Ruff, J rge Sasse, Thomas Struth, Olafur Eliasson, Roni Horn, Gabriel Orozco, Hiroshi Sugimoto, Matthew Barney, Gregory Crewdson, Anna Gaskell, Sam Taylor-Wood, Oliver Boberg, James Casebere, Thomas Demand, Vanessa Beecroft, Wolfgang Tillmans, Patty Chang, Trisha Donnelly, Stan Douglas, Pierre Huyghe, William Kentridge, Steve McQueen, Shirin Neshat, John Pilson and Gillian Wearing.</p><p></p><h2>Private Practice: In the Early Twentieth-Century Medical Office of Dr. Richard Cabot</h2><p><p>The beginning of the twentieth century marked the rise of advanced medical technologies, allowing doctors to diagnose and treat diseases in new ways.

This foundational study draws upon the joint strengths of current music history and music theory to outline a new, up-to-date paradigm for understanding the compositional choices found in the instrumental works of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, and their contemporaries: sonatas, chamber music, symphonies, overtures, and concertos. In so doing, it also lays out the indispensable groundwork for anyone wishing to confront the later adaptations and deformations of these basic structures in the nineteenth and earlier twentieth centuries.<br><br> Combining insightful music analysis, contemporary genre theory, and provocative hermeneutic turns, the book brims over with original ideas, bold and fresh ways of awakening the potential meanings within a familiar musical repertory. <em>Sonata Theory</em> grasps individual compositions-and each of the individual moments within them-as creative dialogues with an implicit conceptual background of flexible, ever-changing historical norms and patterns. These norms may be recreated as constellations "compositional defaults," any of which, however, may be stretched, strained, or overridden altogether for individualized structural or expressive purposes. This book maps out the terrain of that conceptual background, against which what actually happens-or does not happen-in any given piece may be assessed and measured.<br><br> The <em>Elements</em> guides the reader through the standard (and less-than-standard) formatting possibilities within each compositional space in sonata form, while also emphasizing the fundamental role played by processes of large-scale circularity, or "rotation," in the crucially important ordering of musical modules over an entire movement. The book also illuminates new ways of understanding codas and introductions, of confronting the generating processes of minor-mode sonatas, and of grasping the arcs of multimovement cycles as wholes. Its final chapters provide individual studies of alternative sonata types, including "binary" sonata structures, sonata-rondos, and the "first-movement form" of Mozart's concertos.<br></p><p><br><strong>James Hepokoski </strong>is Professor of Music at Yale University.

It reconceptualizes the sonata style of the late eighteenth century in ways consonant with the theory of the time but from the perspective of a present-day listener, one whose life experiences are shaped not by carriages and quills but by<br>jets and computers. Its signal virtue is the way it tracks an expert listener's mental construction of a musical work as it unfolds in real time.

With the publication of Elements of Sonata Theory we now have the real item. Sonata theory is, first and foremost, a theory of genre: Hepokoski and Darcy have<br>immersed themselves for many years in the repertoire that they study, and they argue persuasively for the generic conventions that undergird their study. Sonata theory is also an analytic method: deep knowledge of convention and compositional practice engenders a finely-tuned tool that enables<br>perceptive and sensitive musical analysis. Finally, sonata theory is a means of hermeneutic interpretation: expressive meaning arises out of the interaction of the individual work with generic convention. The meticulous scholarship and the analytical insight of the elementsrepresent the best<br>possible collaboration of musicology and music theory."--Patrick McCreless, Professor of Music Theory, Yale University<br> "This is not only a large book but a hugely ambitious one.

Insisting, instead, that critics focus on the most repressed element of African-American criticism--the language of the text--Gates advocates the use of a close, methodical analysis of language, made possible by modern literary theory. Throughout his study, Gates incorporates the theoretical insights of critics such as Bakhtin, Foucault, Lacan, Derrida, and Bloom, as he examines the modes of representation that define black art and analyzes the unspoken assumptions made in judging this literature since its inception.<br> Ranging from the eighteenth-century poet, Phillis Wheatley, to modern writers, Ishmael Reed and Alice Walker, Gates seeks to redefine literary criticism itself, moving away from a Eurocentric notion of a hierarchical canon--mostly white, Western, and male--to foster a truly comparative and pluralistic notion of literature.<br></p><p>This insightful book, written by a leading scholar in African-American studies, attacks the notion of African-American literature as a kind of social realism.

In <em>Vainglory</em>, Mrs. Shamefoot, who "almost compels a tear," embraces the quest for a cathedral stained-glass window "that should be a miracle of violet glass." In&nbsp;<em>Inclinations,</em> Miss Brookomore, filled with longing for her companion, the "sunny" Miss Mabel Collins, travels to Greece where Mabel, rather treacherously, acquires a husband and baby. And in <em>Caprice</em>, Miss Sinquier flees her rural parents and the comfort of her black slippers ("all over little pearls with filigree butterflies that trembled above her toes") to pursue an acting career in bohemian London. To quote Mrs. Shamefoot describing a novelist clearly meant to be Firbank: &#x201c;He has such a strange, peculiar style. His work calls to mind a frieze with figures of varying heights trotting all the same way. If one should by chance turn about it&#x2019;s usually merely to stare or to sneer or to make a grimace. Only occasionally his figures care to beckon. And they seldom really touch." Originally published in 1951, <em>Three More Novels</em> by Ronald Firbank is now reissued as a New Directions Paperbook.</p><p>Ronald Firbank (1886&#x2013;1926) was an acclaimed British novelist whose work was championed by E. M. Forster and Evelyn Waugh. He attended Trinity Hall, Cambridge, although he left before receiving a degree. He traveled extensively through Spain, Italy, the Middle East, and North Africa. He died of lung disease while in Rome in 1926.&#x201c;Firbank is an example of a timeless author who should not be forgotten, because he is utterly unique.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Independent</em></strong></p><h2>Avian Medicine: Principles and Application</h2><p>With the increased need for competent avian practitioners and the formation of avian specialty programs worldwide, clinicians as well as academics are required to have a more comprehensive understanding of applied anatomy, physiology, internal medicine, pharmacology, disease management and preventative medicine.

The kernel is Linux--in the case of the Linux operating system, it's the only bit of software to which the term "Linux" applies. The kernel handles all the requests or completed I/O operations and determines which programs will share its processing time, and in what order. Responsible for the sophisticated memory management of the whole system, the Linux kernel is the force behind the legendary Linux efficiency.The new edition of <i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i> takes you on a guided tour through the most significant data structures, many algorithms, and programming tricks used in the kernel. Probing beyond the superficial features, the authors offer valuable insights to people who want to know how things really work inside their machine. Relevant segments of code are dissected and discussed line by line. The book covers more than just the functioning of the code, it explains the theoretical underpinnings for why Linux does things the way it does.The new edition of the book has been updated to cover version 2.4 of the kernel, which is quite different from version 2.2: the virtual memory system is entirely new, support for multiprocessor systems is improved, and whole new classes of hardware devices have been added. The authors explore each new feature in detail. Other topics in the book include:</p><ul><li>Memory management including file buffering, process swapping, and Direct memory Access (DMA)</li><li>The Virtual Filesystem and the Second Extended Filesystem</li><li>Process creation and scheduling</li><li>Signals, interrupts, and the essential interfaces to device drivers</li><li>Timing</li><li>Synchronization in the kernel</li><li>Interprocess Communication (IPC)</li><li>Program execution</li></ul><i>Understanding the Linux Kernel</i>, Second Edition will acquaint you with all the inner workings of Linux, but is more than just an academic exercise. You'll learn what conditions bring out Linux's best performance, and you'll see how it meets the challenge of providing good system response during process scheduling, file access, and memory management in a wide variety of environments. If knowledge is power, then this book will help you make the most of your Linux system.</p><p><p>received a degree in mathematics in 1992 and a Ph.D. in computer science (University of Rome, "La Sapienza") in 1995.

The brutality of the campaign soon exceeded wolves&#x2019; misdeeds. Wolves menaced property, not people, but storytellers often depicted the animals as ravenous threats to human safety. Subjects of nightmares and legends, wolves fell prey not only to Americans&#x2019; thirst for land and resources but also to their deeper anxieties about the untamed frontier.</p><p><br> Now Americans study and protect wolves and jail hunters who shoot them without authorization. Wolves have become the poster beasts of the great American wilderness, and the federal government has paid millions of dollars to reintroduce them to scenic habitats like Yellowstone National Park.</p><p><br> Why did Americans hate wolves for centuries?

W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts, 51)</h2><p><p>This is a groundbreaking examination of one of the most important artists in the Western tradition by one of the leading art historians and critics of the past half-century. In his first extended consideration of the Italian Baroque painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio (1573-1610), Michael Fried offers a transformative account of the artist's revolutionary achievement. Based on the A. W. Mellon Lectures in the Fine Arts delivered at the National Gallery of Art, <i>The Moment of Caravaggio</i> displays Fried's unique combination of interpretive brilliance, historical seriousness, and theoretical sophistication, providing sustained and unexpected readings of a wide range of major works, from the early Boy Bitten by a Lizard to the late <i>Martyrdom of Saint Ursula</i>. And with close to 200 color images, <i>The Moment of Caravaggio</i> is as richly illustrated as it is closely argued. The result is an electrifying new perspective on a crucial episode in the history of European painting.</p><p> Focusing on the emergence of the full-blown "gallery picture" in Rome during the last decade of the sixteenth century and the first decades of the seventeenth, Fried draws forth an expansive argument, one that leads to a radically revisionist account of Caravaggio's relation to the self-portrait; of the role of extreme violence in his art, as epitomized by scenes of decapitation; and of the deep structure of his epoch-defining realism. Fried also gives considerable attention to the art of Caravaggio's great rival, Annibale Carracci, as well as to the work of Caravaggio's followers, including Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, Bartolomeo Manfredi, and Valentin de Boulogne.</p></p><p><p>"Seldom does one encounter a profoundly surprising yet rigorously historical reading of a very familiar work; in <i>The Moment of Caravaggio</i> this happens with painting after painting. Though an account primarily of Caravaggio and his circle, Fried's discussions of address, of autonomy, of interiority, and of the <i>dispositif</i> of easel painting, among other topics, will resonate across the field. Every scholar of early modern art should read this book."<b>--Michael W. Cole, Columbia University</b></p><p>"No one sees paintings better than Michael Fried, or thinks as persistently or with such philosophical depth about such seeing, about the very possibility of pictorial meaning. <i>The Moment of Caravaggio</i> is a spectacular, compelling addition to his oeuvre. An engrossing and often simply thrilling read, the book is a triumph."<b>--Robert B. Pippin, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"This is a dazzling tour de force. Michael Fried's readings of a series of Caravaggio's most fascinating and enigmatic pictures keep one turning the pages with the greatest pleasure. Fried's arguments are compelling, muscular, and graceful."<b>--Leonard Barkan, Princeton University</b></p><b>Michael Fried</b> is the J. R. Herbert Boone Professor of Humanities and the History of Art at Johns Hopkins University.

Ladd's career as a biblical scholar can be seen as a quest to rehabilitate evangelical thought both in content and image, a task he pursued at great personal cost. Best known for his work on the doctrine of the Kingdom of God, Ladd moved from critiquing his own movement to engaging many of the important theological and exegetical issues of his day. <br><br>Ladd was a strong critic of dispensationalism, the dominant theological system in conservative evangelicalism and fundamentalism, challenging what he perceived to be its anti-intellectualism and uncritical approach to the Bible. In his impressive career at Fuller Theological Seminary, Ladd participated in scholarly debates on the relationship between faith and historical understanding, arguing that modern critical methodologies need not preclude orthodox Christian belief. Ladd also engaged the thought of Rudolf Bultmann, the dominant theological figure of his day. Ladd's main focus, however, was to create a work of scholarship from an evangelical perspective that the broader academic world would accept. When he was unsuccessful in this effort, he descended into depression, bitterness, and alcoholism. But Ladd played an important part in opening doors for later generations of evangelical scholars, both by validating and using critical methods in his own scholarly work, and also by entering into dialogue with theologians and theologies outside the evangelical world. <br> <br> It is a central theme of this book that Ladd's achievement, at least in part, can be measured in the number of evangelical scholars who are today active participants in academic life across a broad range of disciplines.<br></p><p><br><strong>John A. D'Elia</strong> is the Senior Minister of the American Church in London. He is a graduate of UCLA, Fuller Theological Seminary, and the University of Stirling in Scotland. He is from Burbank, California.<br>"George Ladd was arguably the leading 'new evangelical' biblical scholar in the mid-decades of the twentieth century. He was also a person whose life and work were filled with intriguing tensions and contrasts. John D'Elia tells this poignant and fascinating story well." --George M. Marsden, Francis A. McAnaney Professor of History at the University of Notre Dame, and author of Fundamentalism and American Culture<br><br>"In this poignant and gracefully written account, John D'Elia unflinchingly but sympathetically recounts the personal and professional torments of George Eldon Ladd. Making extensive use of Ladd's own files, D'Elia sketches the twin paradoxes of Ladd's life: although eager to find 'a place at the table' of the larger scholarly community, Ladd deemed his own efforts towards that end a failure, and although he wrote extensively of the presence of the kingdom, he struggled to taste its fruits in his own life. Ironically, Ladd never truly understood his greatest legacy his crucial role in the development of evangelical biblical scholarship. D'Elia offers a welcome tribute to Ladd's legacy." --Marianne Meye Thompson, George Eldon Ladd Professor of New Testament, Fuller Theological Seminary<br><br>"D'Elia's biography of George Eldon Ladd is powerful and perceptive. He introduces us to a person who is spiritual and ambitious, intelligent and insecure, bold and troubled all at the same time. This is compelling reading for anyone interested in either the intellectual history of Evangelicalism or the movement's continuing struggle to secure and maintain 'a place at the table' of the mainstream scholarship." --Douglas Jacobsen, Distinguished Professor of Church History and Theology at Messiah College, and author of Thinking in the Spirit: Theologies of the Early Pentecostal Movement</p><h2>Earthly Paradises: Ancient Gardens in History and Archaeology</h2><p>In this beautifully illustrated book, Maureen Carroll examines the most recent evidence of the existence of ancient gardens, the horticultural practices used to plant and maintain them, and the many forms and functions they assumed. Surveying the ancient Near East, Egypt, Greece, Italy, and the provinces of the Roman Empire from the second millennium B.C. to the middle of the first millennium A.D., Carroll finds that whether grown as sources of food, symbols of wealth and prestige, or dwellings for the gods, the cultivation of gardens played an integral role in both the public and private spheres of the ancient world. She concludes with a chapter on the survival of ancient gardening traditions in the Islamic and Byzantine worlds and the ways in which gardens have figured in these cultures' perceptions and depictions of paradise.<br> Culling evidence from a wide variety of archaeological, textual, and pictorial sources, and illustrated with delightful images from tomb and wall paintings, sculptural reliefs, manuscripts, and reconstructions, Carroll provides fascinating insights into the earthly paradises of antiquity.</p><p>Maureen Carroll is a Lecturer in Roman Archaeology in the Department of Archaeology and Prehistory at the University of Sheffield, England.</p><h2>The Colonists (American Family Portraits #2)</h2><p><p>In the years before America became a nation, new generations were born to the Puritans, men and women historians have called The Colonists<br> <br> The untimely death of Benjamin Morgan, great-grandson of Drew Morgan, has splintered his Boston family into feuding factions. Neither eldest son Philip, headstrong daughter Priscilla, nor rebellious young Jared seems to care for each other let alone their father's faith in God. And Constance, Benjamin's widow, is so overcome with loneliness that she can do little to restore harmony. It appears that Drew's dream of a strong Christian heritage, passing without fail from one generation of Morgans to the next, is in jeopardy.<br> <br> When Daniel Cole, an unethical merchant, forces each of the three children as well as their mother to points of crisis and decision, God's Spirit sweeps through the colonies in a dramatic revival. At last, Philip and his siblings see the error of their divisiveness.

This ambitious work examines changes in religious beliefs, in motives for work, in the issues that give rise to political conflict, in the importance people attach to having children and families, and in attitudes toward divorce, abortion, and homosexuality. Ronald Inglehart's earlier book, The Silent Revolution (Princeton, 1977), broke new ground by discovering a major intergenerational shift in the values of the populations of advanced industrial societies. This new volume demonstrates that this value shift is part of a much broader process of cultural change that is gradually transforming political, economic, and social life in these societies.</p><br><p> Inglehart uses a massive body of time-series survey data from twenty-six nations, gathered from 1970 through 1988, to analyze the cultural changes that are occurring as younger generations gradually replace older ones in the adult population. These changes have far-reaching political implications, and they seem to be transforming the economic growth rates of societies and the kind of economic development that is pursued.</p></p><p>This new volume demonstrates that this value shift is part of a much broader process of cultural change that is gradually transforming political, economic, and social life in these societies.<b>"One of Choice's Outstanding Academic Titles for 1991"</b><br><br>"[This book] represents the most ambitious attempt so far to explore what factors can be expected to determine the direction politics will take in the postmodern age. . . . <i>Culture Shift</i> is by far the most detailed, closely argued, and well-supported expos� on the foundation of politics in the postmodern age to date. . ."

He considers experiments in which the scientists' awareness was not perhaps as keen as they might have claimed in retrospect; he investigates the jealousy and opposition that scientific ideas can provoke; he celebrates the scientists who were wrong, but for very good reasons; and he demonstrates how national interest can affect scientists and their theories. The result is an entertaining and highly readable re-examination of scientific discoveries and reputations from the Renaissance to the twentieth century. The tales in <em>Leaps in the Dark</em> range across a wide historical field, from a seventeenth-century witch-finder, Joseph Glanvill, to Sir Robert Watson-Watt, the self-proclaimed 'Father of radar'. Each story underscores the rich, fascinating complexity of scientific discovery.

Very little previous knowledge is assumed; mathematics is kept to a minimum, the treatment being only semi-quantitative. The following chapter uses this quantum mechanical framework to establish the selection rules which govern spectroscopic transitions. Chapters 4 - 7 describe the various branches of spectroscopy covered by the book; rotational, rotational - vibrational, Raman, and electronic spectroscopy. Quantum mechanics is used to derive formulae for the various energy levels involved and for the relative intensities of different types of transition. From these, the appearances of the different types of spectra are derived. The molecular parameters on which these spectra depend are defined and the structural information which can be derived from these is discussed.<br></p><p>Molecular spectroscopy provides a straightforward introduction to the spectroscopy of diatomic molecules and is written at the level of intermediate undergraduate courses in physical chemistry and chemical physics.

Renewables&#x2014;like species&#x2014;keep on coming, provided we do not drive them towards extinction. Non-renewables&#x2014;like oil and gas&#x2014;can only be used once. Together, they are the foundation that ensures our survival and well-being, and the basis of all economic activity. In the face of the global, local, and national destruction of biodiversity and ecosystems, economist Dieter Helm here offers a crucial set of strategies for establishing natural capital policy that is balanced, economically sustainable, and politically viable.<br> &nbsp;<br> Helm shows why the commonly held view that environmental protection poses obstacles to economic progress is false, and he explains why the environment must be at the very core of economic planning. He presents the first real attempt to calibrate, measure, and value natural capital from an economic perspective and goes on to outline a stable new framework for sustainable growth. Bristling with ideas of immediate global relevance, Helm&#x2019;s book shifts the parameters of current environmental debate. As inspiring as his trailblazing <i>The Carbon Crunch</i>, this volume will be essential reading for anyone concerned with reversing the headlong destruction of our environment.</p><p><b>Dieter Helm</b> is Fellow in Economics, New College, Oxford.

Struggling with his homosexuality, the narrator seeks the consolations of a fantastic imagination and fills his head with romantic expectations (&#x201c;I believed without a doubt in a better world, which was adulthood or New York or Paris or love.&#x201d;) His distant, divorced parents exacerbate his hunger for emotional connection, and he endures the unhelpful attentions of a priest and a psychoanalyst. In time, he recognizes the need to be loved by the men in his life and, in the surprising conclusion, escapes his childhood forever with one unforgettable act.<br><br>&#x201c;With <i>A Boy&#x2019;s Own Story</i>, American literature is larger by one classic novel,&#x201d; wrote <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>. &#x201c;No reader, straight or gay . . . can fail to experience shock after shock of recognition in these pages, and few, I would bet, will be able to withhold a one-to-one sympathy from the unnamed narrator, even when he is being, by the standards of only yesterday, &#x2018;shocking.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;The subject of this book might be that brief eloquence between the fantasies of a dream-bound child and his implementing those through charm, sexuality, his wits. . . . This work of principled sweep and great observational power also champions the centrality of Art as a governing quest. It offers this view with a faith that must recall Proust&#x2019;s life project, his attempt to hold all of time, its characters at synchronous ages, all its warring textures, in one head, one work.&#x201d; &#x2014;from the Introduction by <b>Allan Gurganus</b>Edmund White was born in Cincinnati in 1940.

Their work, Marjorie Welish argues, often alludes to the history of art and culture. Also examined are the works of Minimal and Conceptual artists, particularly Donald Judd and Sol LeWitt, who sought to make objective and theoretical artifacts in response to the subjectivity that Abstract Expressionism had promoted. By interpreting the work of these artists in light of contemporary issues, Welish offers a fresh reevaluation of some of the major trends and production of postwar American painting.</p><p>"Welish has done an admirable job....I think any reader of her book will come away with a more sophisticated understanding of issues that have occupied artists since 1960."

The symbiotic perspective on evolution, which argues that "higher species" have evolved from a merger of two or more different kinds of organisms living together, is now clearly established with definitive molecular evidence demonstrating that mitochondria and chloroplasts have evolved from symbiotic bacteria. In telling the exciting story of an evolutionary biology tradition that has effectively challenged many key tenets of classical neo-Darwinism, Sapp sheds light on the phenomena, movements, doctrines, and controversies that have shaped attitudes about the scope and significance of symbiosis. Engaging and insightful, <em>Evolution by Association</em> will be avidly read by students and researchers across the life sciences.<br></p><p><br>Jan Sapp is a professor of Science Studies at York University, Canada. He is author of <em>Beyond the Gene: Cytoplasmic Inheritance and the Struggle for Authority</em> and <em>Where the Truth Lies: Franz Moewus and the Origins of Molecular Biology</em>.<br><br>"Sapp provides some interesting thoughts on what could constitute acceptable 'proof' in biology with respect to 'origin stories,' which seek scientifically to describe nonrepeatable one-time events such as the emergence of eukaryotes in the Precambrian. We might add that this applies equally well to evolutionary and ecological phenomena, most of which are equally unsusceptible to repeatable experiments."--Douglas R. Weiner, <em>Isis, v.87</em><p></p><br>"A thorough, balanced, and readable account of symbiosis research and theory from the 19th century to the present day . . .Sapp accomplishes the delicate task of providing a competent account of the research itself with its limitations and implications while placing it in the particularly rich broader context surrounding the subject of symbiosis and its potential role in evolution. . .A fine piece of scholarship, whole and satisfying in itself." --<em>Science</em><p></p><br>"Many popular studies in the history of science describe events that have either been completed or are past their peak. Sapp's book is not only a scholarly account of one of the most important, yet neglected, areas of 20th-century biology, but it may also be pointing the way to a major element of biology in the next millennium." --<em>New Scientist</em><p></p><br>"Symbiosis is still not taught as a central principle of biological evolution on a par with Darwinian theory and the neo-Mendelian synthesis of heredity. With extraordinary erudition, insight, and clarity of exposition, Sapp's work is a synthesis of history, philosophy, and biology that should go a long way towards repairing this hiatus in the history of ideas." --Joshua Lederberg, University Professor, <em>The Rockefeller University</em><p></p><br>"Most of Sapp's book concentrates on the history of symbiotic theories of the eukaryotic cell, and this theme works well. His chapters that focus on this issue. . .highlight, somewhat unexpectedly, the contributions of Joshua Lederberg. . .I was intrigued by several of Sapp's sociological asides." --<em>Bioscience</em><p></p><br>"Overall, the book is a delightful historical complement to the available texts describing symbiotic associations and a scholarly overview of the conceptual aspects of the subject. It will be enjoyed both by symbiologists and by those interested in the history of biological thought." --<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"The author has assembled a systematic history of this emerging field, in this engaging, wide-ranging account of the growth of an important biological idea." -- <em>Ethology, Ecology and Evolution</em><p></p><br>"By situating the history of symbiosis with within the interstices of biological specialization, Sapp has written a compelling historical narrative that transcends disciplinary allegiances....required reading for all historians of twentieth-century life science." --<em>Journal of the History of</em> <em>Biology</em><p></p><br>"This book. . .skillfully weaves history, politics, egos, indisputable facts, and vigorously disputed interpretations of those facts into a cohesive story. . .It will convince readers of the need for goos libraries, good reviews of the old literature, and a good sense of history no matter how fresh the ideas." --<em>Choice</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Spectrum Language Arts and Math, Grade 5</h2><p>Spectrum(R) Language Arts and Math: Common Core Edition for Grade 5 helps parents understand Common Core standards and helps students master essential Common Core skills.

Can Western medicine find new cures for human ailments by tapping into indigenous plant wisdom? And why the particular interest in the plants with psychoactive properties? These two conference volume proceedings provide an abundance of answers.<br><br>The first international gathering of researchers held on this subject was in 1967, sponsored by the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and U.S. Public Health Service. It was an interdisciplinary group of specialists &#x2013; from ethnobotanists to neuroscientists &#x2013; gathered in one place to share their findings on a topic that was gaining widespread interest: The use of psychoactive plants in indigenous societies. The WAR ON DRUGS which intervened slowed advances in this field.<br><br>Research, however, has continued, and in the fifty years since that first conference, new and significant discoveries have been made. A new generation of researchers, many inspired by the giants present at that first conference, has continued to investigate the outer limits of ethno-psychopharmacology. At the same time, there has been a sea change in public and medical perceptions of psychedelics. There is now a renaissance in research, and some of these agents are actively being investigated for their therapeutic potential. They are no longer as stigmatized as they have been in the past, although they remain controversial. There still remains much work to do in this field, and many significant discoveries remain to be made.<br><br>So, in June of 2017, once again specialists from around the world in fields of ethnopharmacology, chemistry, botany, and anthropology gathered to discuss their research and findings in a setting that encouraged the free and frank exchange of information and ideas on the last 50 years of research, and assess the current and possible futures for research in ethnopsychopharmacology.

"Nice Guys Finish First" shows how cooperation can evolve even in a basically selfish world, and "The Long Reach of the Gene" advances the startling view that genes may reach outside the bodies in which they sit to manipulate other individuals--and even the world at large. The book concludes with completely new endnotes in which Dawkins replies to previous critics, or elaborates on points in the original text.<br> Written in characteristically lively and accessible style, this new edition confirms Dawkins's reputation as one of the most brilliant biologists of his generation.</p><p>Inheriting the mantle of revolutionary biologist from Darwin, Watson, and Crick, Richard Dawkins forced an enormous change in the way we see ourselves and the world with the publication of <i>The Selfish Gene</i>. Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that "our" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since. <p> Why are there miles and miles of "unused" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution. He also introduced the concept of self-reproducing ideas, or <i>memes</i>, which (seemingly) use humans exclusively for their propagation. If we are puppets, he says, at least we can try to understand our strings. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br> <strong>Richard Dawkins</strong> is Lecturer in Zoology and Fellow of New College, Oxford.

Enter Irving Thalberg of Brooklyn, who survived childhood illness to run Universal Pictures at twenty; co-found Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at twenty-four; and make stars of Lon Chaney, Norma Shearer, Greta Garbo, Joan Crawford, Clark Gable, and Jean Harlow. Known as Hollywood's &#x201c;Boy Wonder,&#x201d; Thalberg created classics such as <i>Ben-Hur, Tarzan the Ape Man, Grand Hotel, Freaks, Mutiny on the Bounty,</i> and <i>The Good Earth,</i> but died tragically at thirty-seven. His place in the pantheon should have been assured, yet his films were not reissued for thirty years, spurring critics to question his legend and diminish his achievements. In this definitive biography, illustrated with rare photographs, Mark A. Vieira sets the record straight, using unpublished production files, financial records, and correspondence to confirm the genius of Thalberg's methods. In addition, this is the first Thalberg biography to utilize both his recorded conversations and the unpublished memoirs of his wife, Norma Shearer. <i>Irving Thalberg</i> is a compelling narrative of power and idealism, revealing for the first time the human being behind the legend.</p><p>"I thought I knew the story of Irving Thalberg, Hollywood's fabled boy wonder, but I learned a lot from this well-written, diligently researched book. Mark Vieira immerses us in Thalberg's life and career and sheds new light on the workings of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer at the peak of its powers. This is an altogether remarkable piece of work.

Vieira's book is exceptionally well researched and makes a tremendous contribution to our understanding of an extraordinary era."&#x2015;Kevin Brownlow, film historian and filmmaker<br><br>"Being the son of David O. Selznick and the grandson of Louis B. Mayer, I have read many books about Irving Thalberg, but none has brought this elusive figure to life as does Mark A. Vieira's. Because he had access to Norma Shearer's memoir notes and because he painstakingly reconstructed each year of Thalberg's brief life, a new figure emerges. Where before we saw a gentle and sensitive man who devoted great care to his films, we now see fierce concentration, arrogance, impatience with stupidity, and a compulsion to oversee every detail of every MGM film. Whatever it cost&#x2015;and it cost him his health&#x2015;it resulted in a body of work unprecedented in the history of the medium. <i>I found Irving Thalberg</i> compelling reading and masterly in its ability to keep me reading chapter after astonishing chapter."&#x2015;Daniel Mayer Selznick, film historian and filmmaker<b>Mark A.

Labeled racist and condescending by some contemporary critics, it remains a shocking, controversial, and powerful work -- exposing the attitudes of white nineteenth-century society toward "the peculiar institution" and documenting, in heartrending detail, the tragic breakup of black Kentucky families "sold down the river."

Dr. Rutkow draws on his experience as a surgeon and a historian to provide an enlightening account of the development of surgery in the context of American social, economic, and political history. Interspersed with the narrative is an extraordinary collection of archival photographs and drawings, many of which have never before been published.The first section chronicles the history of American surgery from Native American practices and colonial times to the present. Particular attention is given to the professionalization and specialization of surgery, as well as to the influence of wars, technological advances, and other pivotal events on the profession. The second section details the history of specific surgical specialties. More than 1,000 biographical accounts of famous surgeons are deftly woven into the narrative.</p><p>At the end of the 12th century, King Richard the Lion-Hearted (ruled 1189 to 1199) lay on his deathbed, attended by both physicians and surgeons. This is the first European reference we have to a division between the fields of medical and surgical practice. In subsequent centuries, physicians and surgeons vied with one another for position in the medical marketplace. Eventually, unification, by way of medical education, took place in the modern system. Nevertheless, the difference in the origins and history of these fields is a source of continuing insight into the overall role of medicine in our societies. The surgical story has been well chronicled in histories of European medicine, but not American medicine.<p> Rutkow, a surgeon and prolific historian of surgery, has undertaken the herculean task of assembling a complete history of surgery in the United States. But he does not stop with this labor. Rather, he endeavors to blend the richness of biography with a historically nuanced interpretation of the development of surgery as a profession in the context of social and cultural changes. Rutkow is no novice, nor does he shrink from the huge undertaking. He is aware of a great part of the historian's technical literature and tries to incorporate it in a generally accessible form. He is also aware that the history of surgery has been driven largely by biography. That is what especially interests many surgeons -- the tales of their forebears. To achieve these ends, Rutkow uses four devices to convey the immense amount of material he has assembled. First, he weaves a thoughtful description of the rise of American surgery to international respect and prominence. His presentation is at once chronologic and social in its historiography. Second, he presents abbreviated histories of the individual surgical subspecialties. Wisely, he has found it too difficult to try to interweave these separate tales into his larger narrative. In this section of the book he includes a large portion of the more than 1000 collected biographies of surgeons. Third, he presents, with the able assistance of Dr. Stanley Burns, an extraordinary range of photographic depictions of surgical themes, some never before published. This visual background adds immeasurably to the value of the book. Finally, Rutkow includes historical time lines at the beginning of each of his chronologic chapters, to help the reader place changes in surgery against the framework of contemporary political, social, and cultural events. </p><p> The numerous strengths of this book stem from Rutkow's experience in clinical surgery, public health, and medical history. Thus, technique, policy, and history are all addressed. Moreover, he is sensitive to other segments of history, including the Native American approach to surgery in the time of the Pilgrims. However, he does not discuss separately the history of women in surgery or that of Canadian or Mexican surgery, to jibe more fully with the book's title. Other notable omissions are a history of pediatric surgery (except in the form of a biography of Robert E. Gross) and comparisons with other surgical cultures around the world, to add further context. Nevertheless, Rutkow has performed a great service for both the surgical and medical historical communities in synthesizing so much material in so palatable a form. This book will be required reading for many a trainee and senior surgeon alike. It reminds us how far we in the New World have come from King Richard's doctors, and yet how similar we still are. </p><p> <i>Reviewed by Walton O.

This book is more entertaining than a game of badminton (don't say, "BAD-mitten," which Elster considers sloppy) and more lasting than a daiquiri (that's "DY-kuh-ree"). And best of all, you'll tighten up that flaccid ("FLAK-sid") pronunciation. Kudos ("KOO-dahs") to Elster for setting us straight.

Showing how these concerns became institutionalised and how knowledge came to be transferred from place to place, this book explores important aspects of the forerunners of globalisation. It is a narrative which covers much of Asia, North Africa and Europe, many parts of which were little known beyond their own boundaries. Spanning from the earliest civilisations to the end of the European Middle Ages, around 700 years ago, here the authors set out crucial findings for future research and investigation.</p> <p>This book shows how interconnections across continents are nothing new and that in reality, humankind has been interdependent for a much longer period than is widely recognised.

Instead of placing top priority on the role of tools, the pressure for their skillful use, and the related importance of interpersonal communication as a means for enhanced cooperation, this volume explores quite a different idea-- that the driving force in the evolution of human intellect was social expertise--a force which enabled the manipulation of others within the social group, who themselves are seen as posing the most challenging problems faced by primitive humans. The need to outwit one's clever colleagues then produces an evolutionary spiraling of "Machiavellian intelligence." The book forms a complete and self-contained text on this fast-growing topic. It includes the origins of the basic premise and a wealth of exciting developments, described by an international team of authors from the fields of anthropology, psychology, and zoology. An evaluation of more traditional approaches is also undertaken, with a view to discovering to what extent Machiavellian intelligence represents a complementary concept or one that is truly an alternative. Readers and students will find this fascinating volume carries them to the frontiers of scientific work on the origin of human intellect.<br></p><p>Richard W. Byrne and Andrew Whiten are both at the Psychological Laboratory at the University of St. Andrews.<br>"Unusually well organized, integrated, and edited, unlike so many haphazard collections of edited papers. The theoretical position is intriguing, and the evidence convincing....The papers are generally excellent." --<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"In summary, the reader of <em>Machiavellian Intelligence</em> will find the book promising for generating new hypotheses and additional questions about the evolution of intelligence, phylogenetic differences in social intelligence, and sources of selection pressure for attentional manipulation such as deception, to mention just a few. These topics could be explored fruitfully using the book as a reader in an interdisciplinary seminar with graduate students from psychology, anthropology, and zoology and would surely provide for a lively and thoughtful exchange of ideas and opinions. Clearly the topic of primate social intelligence, enthusiastically launched by this collection of writings, offers much tinder for future research." --<em>International Journal of Primatology</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Real World Image Sharpening With Adobe Photoshop, Camera Raw, and Lightroom</h2><p>Just about every digital image requires sharpening since softness is inevitably introduced during the image digitizing process, and oftentimes with digital photography, images are sharpened badly. This second edition of the definitive book by the late Bruce Fraser teaches readers all they need to know about sharpening, including when to use it, why it's needed, how to use the camera's features, how to recognize an image that needs sharpening, how much to use, what's bad sharpening, and how to fix oversharpening.<br> <i> <br>Real World Image Sharpening with Adobe Photoshop, Camera Raw, and Lightroom, Second Edition</i> is written by Fraser's friend and renowned photographer Jeff Schewe. It adds essential coverage of Adobe Photoshop Lightroom and Adobe Camera Raw, since many of the key sharpening functions have migrated from Photoshop to those tools since the first edition of the book was published.<br> <br>The book shows readers how to: recognize the kind of sharpening that each image needs; become acquainted with the full arsenal of sharpening tools built into Photoshop, Lightroom, and Camera Raw; sharpen part of an image selectively; create a complete sharpening workflow that allows sharpening images optimally for different uses; balance the contradictory demands of sharpening and noise reduction; and more.</p><p><b>BRUCE FRASER</b> was an internationally recognized authority on digital imaging and color image reproduction.

In terms of numbers, beetles are the most successful creatures on earth: about 350,000 species of beetles have been described since 1758. They range from tiny to gigantic, occupy sundry habitats, and eat everything--plants, animals, and their own remains. <i>An Inordinate Fondness for Beetles</i> provides an engaging look at these magnificent yet poorly understood creatures and highlights the absolutely essential role they play in the dynamics of nearly every terrestrial ecosystem on Earth. And, as this book beautifully demonstrates, the aesthetics of beetle design are amazing. The fantastic colors and shapes of these creatures warrant the gorgeous color photography lavished on them in this book.</p><p>There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that an English cleric asked the noted evolutionist J.B.S. Haldane what could be inferred about the Creator from the works of nature. Haldane is reported to have replied, "An inordinate fondness for beetles." <p>! In fact, approximately one-fifth of all known species are beetles--350,000 and growing (and yours truly even discovered a beetle species in 1986)--yet most people know very little about this remarkable group of organisms. This is one of the best coffee-table books I have ever seen about the creepy critters, and the full-color photos of iridescent, brightly colored, or architecturally elaborate beetle gems is sure to instill an inordinate fondness for beetles among children, artists, and anyone with a love of nature.</p><b>Arthur V.

Although we can no longer comprehend the objects left to us with the same depth of understanding as early Hawaiians, we can appreciate their aesthetic qualities and the skill used in their construction, particularly when numerous pieces of the same type are viewed together.</p><p><i>Links to the Past</i> makes this possible by reuniting more than a thousand eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century Hawaiian artifacts from over seventy institutions and collections worldwide. The book is divided into twenty-one sections (wooden bowls, gourds, stone vessels, etc.), each introduced with color photographs, quotes from contemporary sources, and brief historical and technical information. These are followed by dozens of line drawings (more than 1,400 in all) based on actual artifacts or photographs and drawn to scale within each object category. Together they support and enhance learning about object shapes, patterns, sizes, and, in some cases, change over time. Accurate and detailed illustrations reproduce gourd, basket, and mat patterns&#x2015;now faded and almost invisible on the objects themselves&#x2015;as clearly and vibrantly as when they were first created.</p><p><i>Links to the Past</i> is unique in bringing together hundreds of traditional Hawaiian objects in one publication. In the case of fans, helmets, and patterned water gourds, almost every known artifact is represented. Numerous pieces presented here have rarely or never been seen in print. The book will prove invaluable to those involved in the study and creation of Pacific art and visual culture and readers interested in early cultural exchange and pattern and design among indigenous cultures.</p></p><p>Early praise: <p> "In <i>Links to the Past,</i> Wendy Arbeit makes an important contribution to the study, and appreciation, of Hawaiian material culture. The period covered, from James Cook's arrival in 1778 to later European and American voyages into the 1830s, establishes a critical base-line for documenting the changes in material culture brought about by Western intervention, and Hawaiian reactions to those intrusions. This book is without a doubt the most comprehensive compilation of Hawaiian design available and goes a long way toward addressing the limitations of standard works that offer only one or two `characteristic' objects of a given kind. Instead, Arbeit presents numerous examples of each artifact type, giving a more complete view of the range and variation of Hawaiian creativity." --Roger G. Rose, Bishop Museum </p><p> "Often ethnographic objects of daily use have been relegated to the level of crafts, treated as technical curiosities and not seen as objects of bold imagination and pride. In early contact Hawai`i there was an extraordinary number of functional items of very high quality that the literature has largely treated in a very narrow descriptive manner. Links to the Past goes a long way to remedy that situation by providing both a historical and ethnographical context while highlighting the important aesthetic role that such items had and still convey in Hawaiian society." --Jerome Feldman, Hawai`i Pacific University</p><b>Wendy S.

It presents the facts, theories, and processes of developmental psychology in a clear, easy-to-read style. Shaffer stresses the fundamental interplay among biological, cognitive, social, and cultural influences of each aspect of development so readers don&#39;t lose sight of the whole person and the holistic character of human development. Students learn new topics as they are introduced, and then are shown how everything they&#39;ve learned fits together into a coherent storyline of developmental psychology. Throughout the book, Shaffer clearly describes the major points of the major theories, compares them to other theories, shows their strengths and weaknesses, and admits when conflicts have not been resolved. The book is organized topically to focus intently on developmental processes and to provide the student with an uninterrupted view of the sequences of change that children and adolescents experience within each developmental domain.

Beautifully illustrated, the book explores the milestones in elementary mathematics that enliven the understanding of these buildings and combines this with an in-depth look at their aesthetics, history, and structure. Whether using trigonometry and vectors to explain why Gothic arches are structurally superior to Roman arches, or showing how simple ruler and compass constructions can produce sophisticated architectural details, Alexander Hahn describes the points at which elementary mathematics and architecture intersect.</p><br><p> Beginning in prehistoric times, Hahn proceeds to guide readers through the Greek, Roman, Islamic, Romanesque, Gothic, Renaissance, and modern styles. He explores the unique features of the Pantheon, the Hagia Sophia, the Great Mosque of Cordoba, the Duomo in Florence, Palladio's villas, and Saint Peter's Basilica, as well as the U.S. Capitol Building. Hahn celebrates the forms and structures of architecture made possible by mathematical achievements from Greek geometry, the Hindu-Arabic number system, two- and three-dimensional coordinate geometry, and calculus. Along the way, Hahn introduces groundbreaking architects, including Brunelleschi, Alberti, da Vinci, Bramante, Michelangelo, della Porta, Wren, Gaud�, Saarinen, Utzon, and Gehry.</p><br><p> Rich in detail, this book takes readers on an expedition around the globe, providing a deeper understanding of the mathematical forces at play in the world's most elegant buildings.</p></p><p><p>"The mathematical analysis of building structures is essential to the understanding of architecture. Yet most texts available are abstract and not specific to the importance of such study. At last, Alexander Hahn has provided a thorough and beautifully illustrated mathematical look at the world's greatest buildings that will remedy this void and provide a relevant and absorbing study for architects and others interested in the art of building.

By relying on a formula and preplanning the conversation, difficult conversations can be structured in a way that does not digress into an emotional shouting match ...

It provides a survey and analysis of the key issues, figures and concepts.</p><p>The most influential readings in twentieth-century analytic philosophy comprise this substantial anthology. The classic &amp; contemporary selections provide a survey &amp; analysis of the key issues, figures, &amp; concepts in the field.This substantial anthology comprises the most comprehensive and authoritative collection of readings in analytic philosophy of the twentieth century. It provides a survey and analysis of the key issues, figures and concepts.<br> <p>The volume is divided into seven sections: philosophy of language, metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, free will and personal identity, ethics, and methodology. It includes the most familiar texts of the analytic tradition, as well as several others that are less often anthologized. Several articles are logically related to each other. For example, Moore's <i>Four Forms of Skepticism,</i> appears together with selections from Wittgenstein's <i>On Certainty;</i> Langford's discussion of the paradox of analysis and Moore's reply are both included; and Quine's <i>Two Dogmas of Empiricism</i> is paired with Grice and Strawson's <i>In Defense of a Dogma.</i><br> </p> <p>The distinctive selections and internal coherence make this anthology an invaluable guide for anyone interested in twentieth-century and analytic philosophy.</p></p><h2>Mental Reality, second edition, with a new appendix (Representation and Mind series)</h2><p><p><b>An argument against neobehaviorism and for "naturalized Cartesianism," which couples a wholly materialist approach to the mind with a fully realist attitude to the phenomena of conscious experience.</b></p><p>In <i>Mental Reality</i>, Galen Strawson argues that much contemporary philosophy of mind gives undue primacy of place to publicly observable phenomena, nonmental phenomena, and behavioral phenomena (understood as publicly observable phenomena) in its account of the nature of mind. It does so at the expense of the phenomena of conscious experience. Strawson describes an alternative position, "naturalized Cartesianism," which couples the materialist view that mind is entirely natural and wholly physical with a fully realist account of the nature of conscious experience. Naturalized Cartesianism is an adductive (as opposed to reductive) form of materialism. Adductive materialists don't claim that conscious experience is anything less than we ordinarily conceive it to be, in being wholly physical. They claim instead that the physical is something more than we ordinarily conceive it to be, given that many of the wholly physical goings on in the brain constitute&#x2015;literally are&#x2015;conscious experiences as we ordinarily conceive them.</p><p>Since naturalized Cartesianism downgrades the place of reference to nonmental and publicly observable phenomena in an adequate account of mental phenomena, Strawson considers in detail the question of what part such reference still has to play. He argues that it is a mistake to think that all behavioral phenomena are publicly observable phenomena.This revised and expanded edition of <i>Mental Reality</i> includes a new appendix, which thoroughly revises the account of intentionality given in chapter 7.</p></p><p>Galen Strawson taught philosophy at the University of Oxford for twenty years before moving to the University of Reading in 2001. He was Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New York Graduate Center from 2004-2007. Since 2012 he has been President&#39;s Chair in Philosophy at the University of Texas in Austin.<p>Praise for the first edition: In <i>Mental Reality,</i> Galen Strawson tries to determine what the fundamental and difficult questions about the mind are, and to answer them. His answers are iconoclastic and brilliant, especially his sustained criticism of behaviorism, functionalism and of certain ideas associated with Wittgenstein.</p>&#x2015;<b>Paul Snowdon</b>, <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i><br><br><p>Praise for the first edition: Perhaps the most detailed and convincing refutation of behaviorism given yet in philosophy.</p>&#x2015;<i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br><p>Praise for the first edition: Strawson's inquiry explores a remarkable range of hard questions with care and insight.</p>&#x2015;<b>Noam Chomsky</b>, <i>Philosophy and Phenomenological Research</i></p><h2>Leisureville: Adventures in America&#39;s Retirement Utopias</h2><p>When his next-door neighbors in a quaint New England town suddenly pick up and move to a gated retirement community in Florida, Andrew D. Blechman is astonished by their stories. Larger than Manhattan, with a golf course for every day of the month, two downtowns, its own newspaper, radio, and TV stations, The Villages is a city of nearly one hundred thousand (and growing), missing only one thing: children. More than twelve million people will soon live in these communities, and to get to the bottom of the trend, Blechman delves into life in the senior utopia. He offers a hilarious first-hand report on all its peculiarities, from ersatz nostalgia and golf-cart mania to manufactured history and the residents&#x2019; surprisingly active sex life, and introduces us to dozens of outrageous characters. <i>Leisureville</i> is also a serious look at a major and underreported trend, only to get bigger as the baby boomers retire. Blechman travels to Arizona to show what has happened after decades of segregation. He investigates the government of these instant&#x201d; cities, attends a builder&#x2019;s conference, speaks with housing experts, and examines the implications of millions of Americans dropping out of society and closing the gates on kids.</p><p>"Blechman's primary interest is not in the eerily false perfection of such places, but rather in the American psychology of segregation, radical individualism and the fears underlying the dreams of their residents... [Leisureville is] part exurban expose, part postmodern Roald Dahl parable." -<i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i>"Andrew Blechman's account of the rampant unreality that has become the normal condition of life in Florida's child-free retirement ghettos is fascinating. The generation that enjoyed the greatest economic boom in the history of the world is going out with a bang--the sound of society blowing up in our faces. Blechman has a laser eye for the tragicomic absurdities of all the fun, games, and wild sex in theme-park senior villages where Oz-like control is exercised by the developer and his minions. His mordant report from a strange land is consistently interesting." --James Howard Kunstler, author of The Long Emergency <br> <br> <p>"Engaging . . . [Blechman] confronts the troubling trend toward isolation and escapism." --Publishers Weekly <br> <br> </p><p>"Tottering along as I am toward my golden years, I found this monograph by Andrew Blechman to be fun, informative, endlessly fascinating, and even a little frightening. The author's narrative of his rollicking tour of America's age-restricted, retirement utopias provides readers with wonderful, anecdotal accounts of the history of these communities, the life therein, and the compelling social issues that such developments raise for us all. This is a volume that should be read by everyone regardless of age."--Joe Drabyak, Chester County Book &amp; Music Company, West Chester, PA <br> <br></p></p><h2>Retailing in Emerging Markets</h2><p><p>Emphasizing the apparel and beauty industries, <i>Retailing in Emerging Markets</i>, 2nd Edition provides an in-depth study of the retail landscape within Brazil, China, India, Russia, Turkey, Qatar, Thailand, South Korea and Mexico.

Managers correct mistakes. That's their right.<br><br>But no one can give a boss the right to call you an ignoramus, especially in front of an audience. Somehow you have to reduce the abuse dished out by narcissistic, bullying, or heartless villains. Telling them off and storming out in a huff won't help. The fleeting satisfaction you receive from landing a verbal punch is a luxury you can't afford.<br><br>We're going to look at a better method for letting go of the hurt and going after what's really important to you: getting ahead in your job. You'll choose different strategies, depending on whether or not the boss is intentionally hostile. Either way, you can't assume you know what bosses want from you; they themselves must tell you what's on their minds.<br><br>However, you can't reason with the enraged. Wait until the boss calms down, then talk it over and, at least, agree on objectives. Listen hard, plot your strategy, and think before you speak up. That's how to handle a hostile boss.<br><br>Narcissists<br><br>Narcissists are ego-driven, big-headed, cold-blooded individuals who expect total loyalty from others without being loyal in return.<br><br>Narcissistic bosses take all the credit for any successes at work and lash out at those who do not demonstrate their trustworthiness. They are sneaky because they outwardly appear cool, calm, and collected. Yet those who know them feel that they are ticking time bombs and tiptoe around them so as not to be in their path.<br><br>Narcissists have the uncanny ability to make you feel like gold one moment and like dirt the next. When they explode, it's with a no-holds-barred attitude. Anything is fair game, including exposing information that was shared in private.<br><br>Of course, your boss should expect loyalty. However, not knowing when you will be in the "hot seat" is demoralizing and unnerving.<br><br>What You're Thinking<br><br>When I took this job, I had no idea that my polished boss could be so mean! I've learned that my day is much more pleasant if I can stay below his radar. Knowing that my actions are constantly being scrutinized has me jumping out of my skin. Just the other day, my boss praised me privately and then outwardly embarrassed me five minutes later because he felt that I crossed him. What's next? Why is he so flippant and hypercritical?<br><br>A Narcissist's Thoughts<br><br>I'm responsible for this whole team. None of these workers would be anywhere without me. I can be someone's best friend or worst enemy. If people cross the line with me, then they deserve to be exposed and ridiculed. After all, why should I respect workers who aren't loyal to me?<br><br>Strategy<br><br>Your goal is to be treated with respect by reducing hostility and developing mutual trust.<br><br>1. Respect yourself. You can speak up without either cringing or being insubordinate.<br><br>2. Clarify expectations. Don't leave a conversation without fully understanding what is expected. Then, create a paper trail by recapping your conversation by email.<br><br>3. Highlight priorities. Stress what's important to the company-getting assigned work completed and performed well.<br><br>Tactical Talk<br><br>Boss: (In public.) I need [xyz] done by tomorrow. I'm expecting perfection. You used to be my shining star, but I'm not so sure I can count on you anymore. Maybe I should just give this project to Billy.<br><br>You: What you are asking me to do now is different from what we discussed yesterday. I sent you an email right after our other conversation, to make sure that we were on the same page.<br><br>Boss: Do you think I have time to read all the emails that come through my inbox?<br><br>You: I know that we both have the same goal, which is to do work correctly the first time. I want to meet your standards but am confused about expectations. Is it more important for me to change direction now or to meet the original deadline?<br><br>Tip: Narcissists lack self-confidence, which is why they are so quick to turn on you if your actions will make them look bad. Emphasize your loyalty while standing your ground and you'll be back on their good side in no time. Still, always keep one eye open due to their unpredictable nature.<br><br>Bullies<br><br>Bullies are habitually cruel, threatening your present and future because loss of control frightens them.<br><br>Bullies believe they can maintain control if they use hate and fear as weapons. They appear self-confident and strong because they intimidate weaker people. If you submit, or act afraid, or react with rage, that proves to them that you are inferior and deserve to be disparaged.<br><br>When these bosses belittle you, crushing your self-confidence with their authoritarian threats, your best defense is an offense. You have to stand up to the Bully.<br><br>What You're Thinking<br><br>My boss tortures me with emotional blackmail. If I don't do exactly what she wants when she wants, I'll never get a raise or move up; she could even make me lose my job. I can't afford to upset her, so I hide my anger. But my stomach is in knots over working with this ogre. I'm always tense and on edge.<br><br>A Bully's Thoughts<br><br>These people make me mad. They're so weak and stupid. They can't think anything through. Well, I told them the right way to handle it. Yes, it was the right way. I'll show them who's boss. At any rate, the matter is not negotiable. I must prove I am right. If I frighten them and show them how weak they are, they will see how strong I am.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>Your aim is to protect your job by redeeming your self-esteem, thereby gaining the Bully's respect. Stop accepting the situation. Arm yourself with friendliness and self-confidence and avoid a clash of wills.<br><br>1. Practice confrontation at home. You want to appear firm, strong, and unemotional-even if you're shaking in your boots. Make a video of this practice run. Review it to perfect your content, tone, and body language.<br><br>2. Let Bullies vent their anger without interrupting them; then focus on their concerns. In a pleasant tone, pose questions to get them to disclose what's really bugging them. They may be Bullies, but they're human, so don't be surprised if they react positively when you show concern for their feelings.<br><br>Tactical Talk<br><br>Boss: You are wrong. Shut up and listen and then do as you're told, or else you can empty out your desk and you're history.<br><br>You: Okay, Boss, I can see you don't agree. Of course, you have the final say, and I'll do my best-everything I possibly can-to carry out your decision. But it would seem that- (Boss interrupts, but you continue, interrupting the interrupter.)<br><br>You: Excuse me, I'm not through. Give me thirty seconds to finish this point. If [xyz] causes the problem, what would happen if we shifted the . . . ?<br><br>Tip: Bullies lose their power if you don't cower. Deep down, they doubt they deserve your respect. They admire you for speaking with self-assurance and confidence. So when they bombard, don't counterpunch. Win them over with your strong, firm, courteous demeanor.<br><br>Ruthless Monsters<br><br>Ruthless Monsters take pleasure in causing you difficulty.<br><br>Ruthless Monsters also are hostile, but their joy is in catching you in a mistake and making you squirm. With an "Aha, gotcha!" look, they get their kicks out of attacking you or threatening to fire you, and it's more delightful for them if their reprimand is given in front of your colleagues or customers.<br><br>Ruthless Monsters demand blind obedience, but keep changing the rules to fit their whims. They berate you for errors they initiated and then not only deny any responsibility, but also fail to show you a better way.<br><br>With no letup, Ruthless Monsters are deliberately mean. You can't disagree with them without making matters worse. You have to find a way to keep them from sapping your spirit and all but eradicating your ego.<br><br>What You're Thinking<br><br>My boss just isn't happy unless he's degrading his staff. He purposely tries to make me look foolish or inept. I am particularly upset because he asked me to talk frankly with him when I had any problem with my department, but when I did, he used my voluntary information to give me a poor performance review. He humiliates me for mistakes and punishes me for problems! I've started covering up instead of talking to him, because I think he's making me a scapegoat to protect his own position.<br><br>A Ruthless Monster's Thoughts<br><br>I've got to shake my people out of their complacency. If I embarrass them some more, I can motivate them to work faster. But this is cutting into the time I'd planned to use for developing the new system. I guess I'll have to push a little harder. So what if I have to break a few company regulations in the process? It's coming out ahead of my colleagues and keeping in tight with those upstairs that counts.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>Your immediate goal is to reduce your daily stress on the job. You can move along two tracks simultaneously.<br><br>1. Try a shock treatment. Stand up for yourself by asking your boss to please sit down, looking him in the eye without blinking, and calmly stating that you wish to be treated with the respect due another human being. Your unexpected action may get him to see you as a person instead of as a punching bag.<br><br>2. Learn what recourse you have in your company. For instance, many organizations have anonymous hotlines for this very purpose. Your Human Resources professional can explain any grievance procedures. If your boss thinks his behavior may be tagged "unprofessional," he'll want to do something to avoid getting in trouble. He very well may let up a little.<br><br>3. Anonymous feedback may be better. If you have no grievance procedure, or are uncomfortable speaking with HR, write to the top boss. Point to high turnover, low morale, or other pervasive problems. Recommend better supervisory training. Propose a formalized system that enables workers to make suggestions to managers positioned above their immediate supervisors.<br><br>Tactical Talk<br><br>Boss: You stupid fool. Can't you follow the simplest orders? How can I run a division when they give me incompetents like you!<br><br>You: Yes, Boss, but which order do you want me to follow-the executive order in the manual or the one you are telling me about now? If I made a mistake, tell me. I'm glad to do whatever you think best. But there's no need to call me names.<br><br>Tip: If the torture continues and you're becoming a physical or emotional wreck, consider making a job move sooner rather than later.<br><br>There are many varieties of belligerent bosses. When a hostile boss attacks you, bottling up your feelings can make you ill. Learn to stand up for yourself and express your anger in a positive way. That's good for you and your boss. As Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, "Nobody can make you feel inferior without your consent." If the hostility becomes overwhelming and you can't change the climate, keep your sanity by looking for work elsewhere. In that case, don't grieve-leave.<br><br>CHAPTER 2<br><br>WHEN YOUR COLLEAGUES ARE BELLIGERENT<br><br>Raging Bulls<br><br>Tacklers<br><br>Cyberbullies<br><br>Enviers<br><br>Intimidators<br><br>It's normal to react angrily when a colleague is hostile to you, or is even aggressive without obvious hostility. Now you have a choice. How are you going to use this anger when you have to deal with Raging Bulls, Tacklers, Cyberbullies, Enviers, and Intimidators?<br><br>If you do nothing but cry about it, your brain will rust. But if you admit to yourself how you're feeling, you begin to put the anger to work. You start dreaming up ways to dispose of your resentment.<br><br>After eliminating the tactics of physically punching aggressors or "accidentally" anointing their heads with hot coffee, free your mind to focus on achieving the objectives that are in your best interest.<br><br>RAGING BULLS<br><br>Raging Bulls erupt unexpectedly, becoming unglued in a violent fit of desk rage.<br><br>Colleagues who were always patient and pleasant now fly off the handle. Like kids throwing temper tantrums, they can't seem to control their anger when something doesn't go the way they anticipated.<br><br>The problem is escalating. Extended hours and tighter deadlines have increased tension in the office. Workers are overwhelmed by nonstop, accelerated speed. Advances in technology-smartphones, remote access, document sharing-mean they never can really leave their work. It's always a click away, even after they start for home.<br><br>Add to the mix noise distractions, interruptions, the stress of worrying about job security, and trying to handle many jobs at the same time to meet new schedules, and bam!-an explosion occurs.<br><br>What You're Thinking<br><br>Why is Justin so edgy lately? He always looks tired and frustrated. It doesn't take much for him to turn a discussion into an argument and start yelling. If I hadn't ducked this morning, I'd have been hit with the book he threw against the wall. It upset me so much that, instead of getting my work done, I spent the rest of the day worrying about what to do when he gets out of control.<br><br>A Raging Bull's Thoughts<br><br>I used to enjoy my work. That was when I had some time off. Now there's no satisfaction, no time for anything but work. I don't sleep, worrying if I'll be in the next batch of layoffs unless I can meet the productivity demands. I check my email day and night to make sure I don't miss an important message from the boss. And as if that's not bad enough, I have to put up with my hateful coworkers. I know I have to control my outbursts, but I also have to watch my back.<br><br>Strategy<br><br>Your objective is to defuse the Raging Bull's anger-to calm him down and win his confidence.<br><br>1. Leave immediately if he starts throwing things. You have to protect yourself. Just say, "We'll discuss this later," and scoot. Your colleague acts childish; you act grown-up.<br><br>2. Interrupt after the Raging Bull winds down. In a calm and friendly voice, keep repeating his name until he hears you.<br><br>3. Be prepared with practical suggestions to reduce the stress he's feeling. Don't analyze his behavior; just mention what you've observed. Discuss ways he might alter his job responsibilities or create more enjoyment. Let him know you want to lend support.<br><br>4. Encourage him to develop alliances. There's less chance he'll think of himself, or be seen, as a victim.<br><br>5. If the behavior continues, speak with your Human Resources professional and/or encourage him to seek professional counseling.<br><br>Tactical Talk<br><br>You: Justin, I can see you're having a tough time lately. I went through something like this a while back. If you'd like, I'll tell you what I learned that pulled me through.</p><h2>Plumb&#39;s Veterinary Drug Handbook: Pocket</h2><p>This is the convenient 5 by 8-inch pocket size; <i>Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook</i> is also available in an 8 � x 11-inch desk size, offering enhanced readability and ease of use. <p>The Eighth Edition of <i>Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook</i> is an up-to-date edition of the most complete guide to drug dosing information for animals available, now with fewer dosages per indication, making it quicker and easier to make a dosage decision.</p> <ul> <li>Fully updated edition of the classic veterinary drug handbook, now with fewer dosages per indication for clearer guidance on selecting a dose</li> <li>Features 43 new drugs, as well as updated dosages and information for existing monographs and new appendices covering multidrug sensitivity in dogs and compounds potentially toxic to animals</li> <li>Offers an authoritative, complete reference for detailed information about animal medication</li> <li>Designed to be used every day in the fast-paced veterinary setting</li> <li>Includes dosages for a wide range of species, including dogs, cats, exotic animals, and farm animals</li> </ul></p><p><p><i>Plumb&#x2019;s Veterinary Drug Handbook, Eighth Edition</i> offers an update to the most extensive and comprehensive source of drug information relevant to veterinary medicine.&nbsp; Easy to use and packed with detailed information encompassing monitoring, chemistry, storage, compounding, and dosages, this bestselling book provides reliable information on the use of an exhaustive list of drugs in a wide variety of species, including dogs, cats, exotic animals, and farm animals.&nbsp; Designed for fast access, the Eighth Edition has been revised to significantly reduce the number of dosage entries for a given indication, providing clearer guidance for selecting the correct dosage.<br> <br> The Eighth Edition adds 43 new systemic drug monographs, and listed dosages have been extensively revised to address FDA status, current clinical use, and supporting evidence.&nbsp; New appendices cover multidrug sensitivity in dogs and provide a list of compounds and ingredients found in common household items and over-the-counter drugs that are potentially toxic to animals.<br> <br> <i>Plumb's Veterinary Drug Handbook</i> is available as both an 8 � x 11-inch desk size, offering enhanced readability and ease of use, and in the convenient 5 by 8-inch pocket size.

Children are the most refractory of all subjects to treat analytically. Here, for the first time, is a primer on the difficult technique as practiced at the Hampstead Clinic in London, which was founded by Anna Freud and is today the leading child analytic center in the world. She and her colleagues expose their wealth of experience to systematic review, which yields up rich insights not only into child psychoanalysis and psychotherapy but also into basic child development. In addition, their findings have relevance to the understanding of emotional disturbance at all ages.</p><p>The book follows the treatment situation through all its stages, from the first session to termination and follow-up. It focuses on the interaction between therapist and child in the treatment room, illustrating the points with copious clinical vignettes. One point examined is the structure of treatment with respect to such matters as scheduling sessions and handling interruptions. Another element that comes under scrutiny is the development of the child's relationship to the therapist, which subsumes such factors as establishing an alliance, transference, and resistance. The child's repertoire of expressions, both verbal and nonverbal, is explored, as is the therapist's armamentarium of interpretations and interventions. Woven throughout the description of these elements is incisive commentary by Anna Freud. Her commonsense approach gives the book unique value, lifting it to a rare level of human wisdom.</p></p><p>&#x201c;One of the most important contributions to the literature of child psychoanalysis to appear in recent years.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Psychoanalytic Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Enormously useful for personal study and contemplation of therapeutic issues as well as an excellent source of topics and concepts around which a seminar on therapy could be organized.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Bulletin of the Menninger Clinic</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A long-needed, systematic presentation of technique, set in a firm foundation of classic and well-reasoned psychoanalytic theory...

After some delay he was summoned to Gondar, which he reached in March, and, largely by his expertise in medicine, began to make friends among the court and clergy. But the Coptic archbishop at Gondar soon prevailed upon the weak Emperor to expel the missionaries, who thus spent only nine months at Gondar, and seventeen months in the country altogether. From Massawa, the missionaries went to Mocha, and thence by courtesy of a French ship to Pondicherry, where Dupleix the governor sent them in October 1752 to L&#39;Orient in France. From there they returned to Rome by way of the Canal du Midi and Marseilles. From Rome Prutky recounts his journey to his home in Bohemia, his interview with Maria Theresa and her consort, and his journey back to Egypt via Leghorn. He then tells of his voyage back to Rome from Alexandria through the Archipelago. The Ethiopian adventure forms the bulk of the whole, and in view of the scarcity of information about that country, is the under-lying reason for translating the book. But Prutky&#39;s account of Mocha, and of the European trading factories there, as well as his description of India and Ceylon as seen during six weeks in Pondicherry, is of no small interest, as is his account of Dupleix&#39; recently completed palace, destroyed in 1761. Both his voyage from Mocha to Pondicherry and his much longer voyage from Pondicherry to France are given added interest by the inclusion of the daily ship&#39;s log. The book ends with a sad account, not written by Prutky, of his final task as Prefect of the mission in St Petersburg from 1766 to 1769, ending with his expulsion from Russia by Catherine the Great and his death in Florence immediately afterwards.</p><p>Henry Arrowsmith-BrownText: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Latin</p><h2>Dawn of Egyptian Art (Metropolitan Museum, New York: Exhibition Catalogues)</h2><p><p>The cultural icons of Pharaonic Egypt, from the&nbsp;Great Sphinx at Giza to the famous burial of Tutankhamun, are among the world's most renowned works of art.

With illustrations of more than 180&nbsp;objects created from about 4000 to 2650 BC, <i>Dawn of Egyptian Art</i> presents the art forms and iconography in which the early Egyptians recorded their beliefs about the land where they lived, the yearly events that took place there, and what they thought was important to the eternal survival of their world.

Today, the Newe hold a fraction of their former territory, still practicing native lifeways while accepting many aspect of American culture. Their story deserves telling.</p><p><i>The Road on Which We Came</i> is the first comprehensive history of the Great Basin Shoshone. Written by historian Steven Crum, an enrolled tribal member, this book presents the Shoshone as an active force in their own history, effectively adapting to harsh physical environment, defending their territory in the nineteenth century, and working to modify or reject assimilationists policy in the present.</p><p>Noting that Native American history did not end with Wounded Knee, Crum gives substantial attention to twentieth-century events up to 1990 and emphasizes that in every period tribal actions can be characterized by a plurality of voices and opinions.</p></p><p><p>Steven J.

The fundamental assumption is that before students of English for academic purposes can begin to successfully produce academic writing, they must have the foundations of language in place--the language tools (grammar and vocabulary) they need to build a text. This text offers a compendium of techniques for teaching writing, grammar, and lexis to second-language learners that will help teachers effectively target specific problem areas of students' writing. <br><br>Based on the findings of current research, including a large-scale study of close to 1,500 non-native speakers' essays, this book works with several sets of simple rules that collectively can make a noticeable and important difference in the quality of ESL students' writing. The teaching strategies and techniques are based on a highly practical principle for efficiently and successfully maximizing learners' language gains. <br><br>Part I provides the background for the text and a sample of course curriculum guidelines to meet the learning needs of second-language teachers of writing and second-language writers. Parts II and III include the key elements of classroom teaching: what to teach and why, possible ways to teach the material in the classroom, common errors found in student prose and ways to teach students to avoid them, teaching activities and suggestions, and questions for discussion in a teacher-training course. Appendices to chapters provide supplementary word and phrase lists, collocations, sentence chunks, and diagrams that teachers can use as needed. <br><br>The book is designed as a text for courses that prepare teachers to work with post-secondary EAP students and as a professional resource for teachers of students in EAP courses.</p><p></p><h2>Kaplan &amp; Sadock's Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry (2 Volume Set)</h2><p>Throughout six prior editions,&#34;CTP&#34; has defined the field of psychiatry.

In this fresh approach, Cole amasses technical detail on manpower, command structure, logistics, and artillery technology and analyzes each detail in light of its impact on the battle. In doing so, he never loses sight of the human drama behind the guns&#x2014;the many tales of heroism and human suffering of the artillery units.

She holds her passion for another man in an emerald ring that disappears repeatedly. Her attempts to recover the precious ring establish her as a genuine heroine.</p><p>The Nobel laureate's bold experiment here with a trade paperback original is a sonorous statement on the feasibility of the format as a vehicle for serious literature and may, indeed, encourage other notables to follow in his footsteps. Bellow's clever but tender novella is also his first book to feature a woman as its principal character. But the formidable Clara Velde is less an anomaly than a vintage Bellow protagonist in skirts. A fortyish executive of an international publishing group, Clara is "the czarina of fashion writing"; the breadwinner of her family, she is a devoted mother of three daughters, whose father is Clara's fourth husband, a colorless, underemployed couch potato. But like the uncle and nephew in More Die of Heartbreak , whose dignified existences are undermined by restless libidos, Clara's powerful facade is vulnerable to the demands of her heart. Two youthful love affairs gone sour had precipitated suicide attempts, and now she is unnerved by the theft of her emerald ring--an engagement ring from a brilliant man she never married but still adores--by the shifty boyfriend of her au pair Gina Wegman, a singularly incisive, young, upper-class Austrian who has ventured into the "Gogmagogsville" of New York City for excitement. Although Clara employs a private eye, this taut yet characteristically subtle tale is no whodunit; what is redeemed here is not chiefly tangible but Clara's sense of self. If the novella's ending is less than full-scale and his characters engage in the usual brand of "mental" conversations, Bellow is also the ever-perspicacious observer of the human condition and modern-day turmoil, who penetrates the soul of a character with a few nimble sentences. He writes, for example, of Clara's eldest, the needy, stout Lucy: "The two little skinny girls laughed at their sister. They scooped up their snickers in their hands while Lucy held herself like a Roman soldier. Her face was heated with boredom and grievances." 150,000 first printing; QPBC dual main selection; author tour. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.Bellow decided to publish this novella as a paperback original after two magazines requested substantial cuts. Since the story of the theft of an emerald ring doesn't really start until some two-thirds of the way through, one can understand the magazine editors' rationale. But one doesn't read Bellow just for his plots; one reads him for his marvelous characterization, his verbal dexterity, his trenchant observations, and his philosophical speculations. Fine reading, this novella is also the most concise statement of the idea that has obsessed Bellow since winning the Nobel Prize: He writes not simply about the theft of a valuable ring but also about the theft of our basic humanity (or soul, as he would say) by the civilization that we, both East and West, have created.

Rather than seeing a five-hundred-pound problem, they see an opportunity for God to show up and show His power.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Chase the Lion</i>&nbsp;is more than a catch phrase; it&#x2019;s a radically different approach to life.

For most people, that situation wouldn&#x2019;t just be a problem...it would be the last problem they ever faced. For Benaiah, it was an opportunity to step into his destiny. After defeating the lion, he landed his dream job as King David&#x2019;s bodyguard and eventually became commander-in-chief of Israel&#x2019;s army under King Solomon.<br><br> Written in a way that both challenges and encourages, this revolutionary book will help unleash the faith and courage you need to identify, chase, and catch the five-hundred-pound dreams in your life.</p><p><b>Mark Batterson</b> is the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of more than a dozen books, including <i>Whisper</i>, <i>In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day</i>, and <i>The Circle Maker</i>.

Lion chasers don&#x2019;t run away; lion chasers run to the roar. They don&#x2019;t see a five-hundred- pound problem; they seize opportunity by the mane. They don&#x2019;t take flight; they fight to the death for their dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> Buried in the second book of Samuel, the twenty-third chapter and the twentieth verse, is one of the most counterintuitive acts of courage in all of Scripture. It&#x2019;s just 1 of 31,102 verses in the Bible, but it&#x2019;s my personal favorite. It&#x2019;s little more than a biblical byline, but it&#x2019;s become the storyline of my life. My life motto is encapsulated in its message&#x2014;<i>chase the lion.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior from Kabzeel. He did many heroic deeds, which included killing two champions of Moab. Another time, on a snowy day, he chased a lion down into a pit and killed it.<br> &nbsp;<br> Napoleon Bonaparte made a distinction &nbsp;between two kinds &nbsp;of courage&#x2014;<i>regular &nbsp;courage </i>and <i>two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the-morning courage. </i>&#x201c;The rarest attribute among Generals,&#x201d; said the Little Corporal, &#x201c;is two o&#x2019;clock- in-the-morning courage.&#x201d; <br><br> Chasing a lion into a pit on a snowy day takes two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the- morning courage. But that one act of courage completely changed the tra- jectory of Benaiah&#x2019;s life. The same is true of you. You are one idea, one risk, one decision away from a totally different life. Of course, it&#x2019;ll probably be the toughest decision you ever make, the scariest risk you ever take. But if your dream doesn&#x2019;t scare you, it&#x2019;s too small.<br> &nbsp;<br> Scripture doesn&#x2019;t explain what Benaiah was doing or where he was going when he crossed paths with the lion. We don&#x2019;t know the time of day or his frame of mind. But it does reveal his gut reaction, and it was gutsy.<br> &nbsp;<br> Put yourself in Benaiah&#x2019;s sandals.<br> &nbsp;<br> Your vision is obscured by falling snow and frozen breath. Out of the corner of your eye, you detect movement. Pupils dilate. Muscles flex. Adren- aline rushes. It&#x2019;s a prowling lion stalking its prey&#x2014;you.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the wild, man versus lion scripts the same way every time. Man runs; lion chases; king of the beasts eats manwich for lunch. But Benaiah flips the script. That&#x2019;s what courage does! I don&#x2019;t know if it was the look in his eye or the spear in his hand, but the lion turns tail and Benaiah gives chase.<br> &nbsp;<br> A fully grown lion can run thirty-six miles per hour and leap thirty feet in a single bound. Benaiah doesn&#x2019;t stand a chance, but that doesn&#x2019;t keep him from giving chase. He can&#x2019;t keep pace, but he can track paw prints in the freshly fallen snow. He comes to the place where the ground has given way beneath the lion&#x2019;s five-hundred-pound frame. Benaiah peers into the pit. Yellow cat eyes glare back.<br> &nbsp;<br> It&#x2019;s a made-for-Hollywood moment. Imagine it on the silver screen. <br> &nbsp;<br> Benaiah walks away from the pit while moviegoers breathe a sigh of&nbsp;relief. But Benaiah isn&#x2019;t walking away; he&#x2019;s getting a running start. The audience gasps as Benaiah turns &nbsp;around and takes a flying leap of faith, disappearing into the darkness. A deafening roar echoes off the walls of the cavernous pit, followed by a bloodcurdling battle cry.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then silence, dead silence.<br> &nbsp;<br> No one is eating popcorn at this point.<br> &nbsp;<br> Everyone expects the lion to strut out, shaking its mane. But no. A&nbsp;human form reaches up and climbs out of the pit. Drops of blood color the&nbsp;snow crimson. Claw marks crisscross Benaiah&#x2019;s spear arm. But against all odds, the valiant warrior from Kabzeel earns an epic victory. <br>&nbsp;<br> Closing credits roll.<br> &nbsp;<br> Then, if I&#x2019;m producing the film, there is a postcredit scene like in the&nbsp;<i>Marvel </i>superhero movies&#x2014;Benaiah&#x2019;s cage fight with a giant Egyptian.<br><br><b>Chase the Lion</b><br> &nbsp;<br> If you find yourself in a pit with a lion on a snowy day, you&#x2019;ve got a problem. Probably the last problem you&#x2019;ll ever have! But you&#x2019;ve got to admit, &#x201c;I killed a lion in a pit on a snowy day&#x201d; looks awfully impressive on your r�sum�, es- pecially if you&#x2019;re applying for a bodyguard position with the king of Israel.<br> &nbsp;<br> Benaiah not only landed his dream job as King David&#x2019;s bodyguard, but his life exceeded his wildest dreams. Benaiah climbed the military chain of command all the way to the top, becoming commander in chief of Israel&#x2019;s army. The lion chaser became the most powerful person in the kingdom of Israel, save the king. But the genealogy of his dream traces back to a fight- or-flight moment. One decision determined his destiny. And not much has changed in the three millennia since then. You can run away from what you are afraid of, but you&#x2019;ll be running the rest of your life. It&#x2019;s time to face your fears, take a flying leap of faith, and chase the lion!<br> &nbsp;<br> In every dream journey there comes a moment when you have to quit living as if the purpose of life is to arrive safely at death. You have to go after a dream that is destined to fail without divine intervention.<br> &nbsp;<br> You have to go big or go home.<br> &nbsp;<br> You have to take the road less traveled or settle for status quo. <br> &nbsp;<br> You have to bite the bullet or turn your back on your dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have a theory: <i>your favorite scripture will become the script of your life. </i>I take my cues from 2 Samuel 23:20. That script underscores who I want to be, what I want out of life, and what I believe about God. <i>Chase the lion </i>is more than a nice catch phrase; it&#x2019;s the metanarrative of my life.<br> &nbsp;<br> Most of us spend our lives running away from the things we&#x2019;re afraid of. We forfeit our dreams on the altar of fear. Or we chase after the wrong&nbsp;things. We&#x2019;re so busy climbing the ladder of success that we fail to realize it&#x2019;s leaning against the wrong wall. <br>&nbsp;<br> At the end of our lives, our greatest regrets will be the God-ordained opportunities we left on the table, the God-given passions we didn&#x2019;t pursue, and the God-sized dreams we didn&#x2019;t go after because we let fear dictate our decisions.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>No Guts, No Glory</b><br> &nbsp;<br> Most people believe God is real, but few people actually live like it. The re- sult is a widening gap between their theology and their reality. They allow their circumstances to get between them and God instead of letting God get between them and their circumstances. Lion chasers measure every- thing against almighty God, including five-hundred-pound &nbsp;lions. That&#x2019;s the difference between being a scaredy-cat and a lion chaser.<br> &nbsp;<br> When everything is said and done, God isn&#x2019;t going to say, &#x201c;Well said,&#x201d; &#x201c;Well thought,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Well planned.&#x201d; There is one measuring stick: &#x201c;Well done, good and faithful servant!&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Faithfulness is not holding down the fort. <br> &nbsp;<br> Faithfulness is chasing five-hundred-pound lions.<br> &nbsp;<br> There is a brand of religiosity that seems satisfied with breaking even&#x2014; <i>don&#x2019;t do this, don&#x2019;t do that, and you&#x2019; ll be okay. </i>The problem with that is this: you can do nothing wrong and still do nothing right. Breaking even is breaking bad. God has called us to play offense with our lives. Those who simply run away from what&#x2019;s wrong will never amount to more than half Christians. The only way to tap your God-given potential, to fulfill your God-ordained &nbsp;destiny is to chase five-hundred-pound lions.<br> &nbsp;<br> God&#x2019;s dream for your life is so much bigger, so much better than break- ing even. If you focus on not making mistakes, you won&#x2019;t make a difference. You don&#x2019;t overcome sin by focusing on <i>not </i>sinning. You need a dream that is bigger and better than the temptations you&#x2019;re trying to overcome. You need a dream that doesn&#x2019;t allow you to become spiritually sidetracked, a dream that demands your utmost for His highest. <br>&nbsp;<br> There is an old aphorism: <i>No guts, no glory. </i>When we lack the guts to go after five-hundred-pound lions, we rob God of the glory He deserves. By definition, a God-sized dream will be beyond your ability, beyond your re- sources. Unless God does it, it can&#x2019;t be done! And that is precisely how God gets the glory. He does things we can&#x2019;t do so we can&#x2019;t take credit for them. God honors big dreams because big dreams honor God.<br> &nbsp;<br> Destiny is not a mystery. Destiny is a decision&#x2014;a difficult decision, a daring decision, a counterintuitive decision. You fulfill your destiny one op- portunity at a time. Of course, those opportunities often come disguised as five-hundred-pound problems. Landing in a pit with a lion on a snowy day qualifies as a bad day, a bad break. But Benaiah didn&#x2019;t see it as bad luck; he saw it as his big break.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re looking for an excuse, you&#x2019;ll always find one.<br> &nbsp;<br> If you&#x2019;re looking for an opportunity, you&#x2019;ll always find one.<br> &nbsp;<br> Lion chasers have an eye for opportunity. There are amazing opportunities all around us all the time, but you have to see them to seize them. Then you need two-o&#x2019;clock-in-the-morning courage to chase them.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Genesis of a Dream</b><br> &nbsp;<br> When I was nineteen years old, I heard a sermon that would change the trajectory of my life. Sam Farina preached about a man named Benaiah, who chased a lion into a pit on a snowy day. I had never heard the story, and I could barely believe it was in the Bible. But a thought fired across my syn- apses: <i>If I ever write a book, I&#x2019; d like to write a book about that verse. </i>That was the genesis of a dream titled <i>In a Pit with a Lion on a Snowy Day.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> It would take sixteen years for that dream to become reality, and I al- most gave up on it a time or two. On October 16, 2006, <i>In a Pit </i>released with very little fanfare. In fact, it almost didn&#x2019;t see its second printing. But <i>In a Pit </i>beat the odds and inspired a generation of lion chasers to go after their dreams. Ten years later <i>In a Pit </i>has a sequel: <i>Chase the Lion.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> I&#x2019;m often asked which of my books is my favorite. You might as well ask me which one of my children is my favorite! I love them all, but there is&nbsp;something unique about seeing your firstborn book on a bookshelf for the first time. <i>In a Pit </i>isn&#x2019;t my best-selling book, but if the measuring stick is life-altering decisions directly resulting from reading it, it might get the grand prize. It&#x2019;s been a game changer for lots of lion chasers, and I&#x2019;ll share some of their dream journeys in <i>Chase the Lion. </i>Their dreams are as different as they are, but each one has chased a lion in his or her own unique way. I hope their five-hundred-pound dreams inspire you as much as they have me. &nbsp;<br> In the prequel to this book, I focused exclusively on King David&#x2019;s body- guard, Benaiah. <i>Chase the Lion </i>is the rest of the story. Like Washington&#x2019;s inner circle or Lincoln&#x2019;s team of rivals, David&#x2019;s thirty-seven mighty men rank as a most remarkable band of brothers. They were insanely coura- geous, fiercely loyal. Their exploits would be unbelievable if they weren&#x2019;t recorded in Scripture. And without them, David&#x2019;s dream of becoming king would have died a fugitive&#x2019;s death.<br> &nbsp;<br> Our destiny is more intricately interwoven with others than any of us realize. The goal of <i>Chase the Lion </i>isn&#x2019;t simply to help you discover <i>your </i>dream. The best way to discover your dream is to help other people accom- plish theirs! That&#x2019;s what the mighty men did, and in so doing, their lives surpassed their wildest dreams.<br> &nbsp;<br> That&#x2019;s my prayer for you.<br> &nbsp;<br> May you discover <i>your God-sized </i>dream in the pages of this book, and may you have the courage to chase it. But your greatest legacy isn&#x2019;t your dream; it&#x2019;s the dreams you inspire in others! You aren&#x2019;t just a dreamer; you are a dreamcatcher.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;As you begin this dream journey, don&#x2019;t go it alone. Dreamers love com- pany! Chase the lion with a friend, a spouse, a mentor. Form a pride, just as lions do. Together you can accomplish far more than the sum total of your shared dreams. The God who is able to do immeasurably more than all you can ask will accomplish something way beyond what you can imagine,7 just as He did for David and his mighty men.<br> &nbsp;<br> And remember, if your dream doesn&#x2019;t scare you, it&#x2019;s too small.</p><h2>Jest Of God</h2><p>Jest of God</p><p>In this celebrated novel, Margaret Laurence writes with grace, power, and deep compassion about Rachel Cameron, a woman struggling to come to terms with love, with death, with herself and her world.<br><br>Trapped in a milieu of deceit and pettiness ? her own and that of others ?

The groundbreaking ethnographic study brings our attention to the full arc of these men&#x2019;s migration experiences, from their upbringing in Mexican cities and towns, to their cross-border journeys, to their incorporation into urban gay communities in American cities, and their sexual and romantic relationships with American men. These men&#x2019;s diverse and fascinating stories demonstrate the intertwining of sexual, economic, and familial motivations for migration.<br> <br> Further, Carrillo shows that sexual globalization must be regarded as a bidirectional, albeit uneven, process of exchange between countries in the global north and the global south. With this approach, Carrillo challenges the view that gay men from countries like Mexico would logically want to migrate to a &#x201c;more sexually enlightened&#x201d; country like the United States&#x2014;a partial and limited understanding, given the dynamic character of sexuality in countries such as Mexico, which are becoming more accepting of sexual diversity. <i>Pathways of Desire</i> also provides a helpful analytical framework for the simultaneous consideration of structural and cultural factors in social scientific studies of sexuality. Carrillo explains the patterns of cross-cultural interaction that sexual migration generates and&#x2014;at the most practical level&#x2014;shows how the intricacies of cross-cultural sexual and romantic relations may affect the sexual health and HIV risk of transnational immigrant populations.</p></p><p><b>H�ctor&nbsp;Carrillo</b> is professor of sociology and gender and sexuality studies at Northwestern University. He is the author of <i>The&nbsp;Night Is Young: Sexuality in Mexico in the Time of AIDS</i>, also published by the University of Chicago Press.&#x201c;<i>Pathways of Desire&nbsp;</i>is an exceptional interdisciplinary study. By exploring the lives of men both before and after migration, Carrillo highlights how major shifts in social contexts due to transnational migration have profound impacts on the men&#x2019;s sexualities, illuminating changes in the lived experience of sexuality in a novel way. Most importantly, Carrillo compares the experience of Mexican gay immigrant men with those of Latino gay men born and raised in the United States, examining the sexual and relational dynamics from the viewpoints of both immigrant and domestic men. This groundbreaking book is a remarkable accomplishment.&#x201d; (<i>Richard Parker, director, Center for the Study of Culture, Politics and Health, Columbia University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This magisterial work by H�ctor Carrillo, the leading scholar of Mexican gay immigrant men, weaves together stories of sex, sexuality, and romance on both sides of the Mexican border. Carrillo offers us a polished theoretical interpretation of the issues, institutions, and aspirations affecting Mexican gay men and everyone in their lives. <i>Pathways of Desire </i>will become a touchstone study for a wide range of fields, including public health, LGBT social analysis, public policy, globalization, and Mexican migration studies. An extraordinary read and a major advance in our understanding.&#x201d; (<i>Matthew Gutmann, Brown University</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;By examining lives both before and after migration Carrillo is able to show both the realities of homophobia and restricted freedom as well as a thriving and growing gay culture in Mexico. He shows that migration scholars should incorporate sexuality into the study of immigration, both for the role it plays in decisions about migration and for its role in shaping assimilation into American society. <i>Pathways of Desire </i>is beautifully written and tells the powerful stories of these migrants. Theoretically innovative and methodologically sophisticated, <i>Pathways of Desire</i> is a tour de force.&#x201d; (<i>Mary C.

Originally buried in splendor in the Valley of the Kings, these mummies were later hidden for safekeeping in a number of easily guarded 'caches' dotted around the vast Theban necropolis. The Royal Mummies, first published in 1912 and long out of print, remains the classic text on the Egyptian royal dead. Profusely illustrated with photographs and line drawings of remarkable quality, it includes extensive physical and archaeological descriptions of all the principal remains of some of Egypt&#x2019;s most famous kings---Ahmose, Tuthmosis III, Amenophis III, Sethos I and Ramesses II.</p><p>Grafton Elliot Smith (1871-1937) was a noted scholar on the history of mummification and a professor at the Cairo School of Medicine, University of Manchester, and University College London.</p><h2>Lives Through Literature: A Thematic Anthology</h2><p><p><b></b> This culturally diverse, gender-balanced anthology is organized by seven types of human relationships: Parents and Children, Sisters and Brothers, Women and Men in Love, Wives and Husbands, Friends and Enemies, Students and Teachers, and People Alone. <b></b> Within each category, readings are also grouped by subthemes and subject clusters&#x2014;often based on essential mythical or biblical themes. The text also features four example-filled chapters on reading skills, critical analysis, and writing about literature. <b></b> For anyone&#x2014;regardless of age, culture, or gender&#x2014;in need of a catalyst to generate dynamic literary discussion and stimulating writing topics. </p></p><p>Preface to the Third Edition <p> Our debt to tradition through reading and conversation is so<br> massive, our protest or private addition so rare and insignificant<br> &#x2013;and this commonly on the ground of reading or hearing<br> &#x2013;that, in a large sense, one would say there is no pure<br> originality. All minds quote. Old and new make the warp and<br> woof of every moment.<br> &#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson's "Quotation and Originality"</p><p></p><p> Lives Through Literature is designed to teach literature and encourage writing. It is a thematic anthology interweaving literary texts that demonstrate interrelationships of life experience as expressed in both sacred and secular myths, parables, folktales, fiction, nonfiction, poetry, and drama. The anthology is aimed primarily at students in the freshman and sophomore English sequences. Selections are drawn from many civilizations and cultures so that we provide a solid core of world literature from the ninth century B.C.E. to the present. We hope that this anthology becomes a catalyst for critical thinking and writing, as well as a source of multicultural literacy. SEVEN UNIVERSAL THEMES </p><p> But there remains the indefeasible persistency of the individual<br> to be himself. One leaf, one blade of grass, one meridian,<br> does not resemble another. Every mind is different; and the<br> more it is unfolded, the more pronounced is that difference.<br> &#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Quotation and Originality"</p><p></p><p> We have chosen seven universal themes that we believe are immediately appealing and relevant to our students' experience as well as to the instructor's experience: Parents and Children, Sisters and Brothers, People in Love, Wives and Husbands, Friends and Enemies, Students and Teachers, and People Alone. Since it is likely that these are the very relationships students are struggling with as they enter and proceed through college, we believe that literature of both immediate and lasting relevance will encourage their active participation in the study of literature and critical thinking and writing. The variety of selections included within each theme reveal a multiplicity of points of view as reflected in the differences in age, culture, class, gender, ethnicity, race, religion, sexual orientation, and philosophy. </p><p> The themes are arranged in a progressive order that loosely follows the path of growth and development that is an integral part of the process of maturation and individuation. Within each theme, material is grouped by genre, and within each genre material is organized to create a dialogue between selections that precede or follow. Part 1, "Parents and Children," focuses on aspects of relationships between parents and children from the perspective of each, such as coming of age, separation, and death. Part 2, "Sisters and Brothers," portrays the nature of sibling loyalty, jealousy, rivalry, and competitiveness. Part 3, "People in Love," and Part 4, "Wives and Husbands," differentiate the experience of love from that of marriage. Focuses include the role time and timing plays in relationships, the experience of falling in love, the nature of love when both partners are single or married, the difficulties caused by unrequited love or love outside a marriage, and so on. Our intent is not to imply that love and marriage are mutually exclusive, but to suggest that they are complex subjects with many facets for analysis and interpretation. Part 5, "Friends and Enemies," explores different types of friendship and the sources of enmity that arise between friends or explode between foes. Part 6, "Students and Teachers," raises fundamental questions regarding how and from whom we learn, the nature of the lesson, and the profound connection between students and teachers. Finally, we have added to the third edition Part 7, "People Alone" which addresses the singularity of the individual in society and family, one's relationship with oneself rather than with others, the distinction between solitude and loneliness, and the ways in which individuals face death. INTERRELATED TEXTS </p><p> Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between<br> the woman and the man before the act of creation can be accomplished.<br> Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole mind<br> must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is<br> communicating his experience with perfect fullness.<br> &#x2014;Virginia Woolf, A Room of One's Own</p><p></p><p> We have been most concerned to select texts that elucidate the main themes of Lives Through Literature and to place them where they will generate dynamic literary discussion and stimulating writing topics. Our criteria are that all works represent literary excellence, a wide range of cultures, and multiple possibilities for juxtaposition, comparison, and contrast. We recognize the arguments over what constitutes the modern canon, and in light of this, we have chosen classic and respected authors such as Homer, Rumi, Shakespeare, Ibsen, Chekhov, Tolstoy, Kafka, Woolf, and Joyce as well as contemporary authors such as Carver, Plath, Hughes, Coover, Munro, Sexton, and Morrison and less widely recognized writers such as Lalla, Yezierska, Hayden, Petry, North, Alvarez, and O'Hagan. Selections range from the traditional to the experimental, from classic to postmodern, from realistic to surreal. Our selections are culturally diverse and sensitive to issues of gender, race, ethnicity, class religion, age, and sexual orientation. SUBJECT CLUSTERS </p><p> Mythology is no man's worn; but what we daily observe in<br> regard to the bon-mots that circulate in society&#x2013;that every<br> talker helps a story in repeating it, until at last, from the slenderest<br> filament of fact a good fable is constructed&#x2013;the same growth<br> befalls mythology: the legend is tossed from believer to poet, from<br> poet to believer, everybody adding a grace or dropping a fault, or<br> rounding the form until it gets an ideal truth.<br> &#x2014;Ralph Waldo Emerson, "Quotation and Originality"</p><p></p><p> By design, we have included a cluster of selections that share similar subject matter but expose quite different points of view. The exploration of multiple views and interpretations is one of the strengths of this anthology. Whereas some clusters appear within one genre of a thematic grouping, others are woven through several genres or even several thematic groupings. For instance, the myth of Daedalus and Icarus appears in several very different forms, first in "Parents and Children" and later in "People in Love" and in "Students and Teachers." Cross-genre clusters on Demeter and Persephone, the Prodigal Son, and Snow White also appear in "Parents and Children." "Sisters and Brothers" has cross-genre clusters portraying the Cain and Abel relationship and the relationship of Hansel and Gretel. "People in Love" includes a cross-genre cluster on The Lady of Shalott, while "Wives and Husbands" has clusters on the relationship between Penelope and Odysseus, the story of Lot's Wife, and the existence of "marriage factories." This section also juxtaposes the Orpheus and Eurydice myth with its American Indian counterpart, "Coyote and the Shadow People," which forms a cluster with H. D.'s poem "Eurydice" and Jorie Graham's poem "Orpheus and Eurydice." "Friends and Enemies" has a cluster of texts portraying the archetype of the double, or shadow. "Students and Teachers" clusters four Zen parables with a poem by a student of Zen. Several poems focusing on the animal as unexpected friend or teacher appear in both "Friends and Enemies" and "Students and Teachers." In "People Alone," the original ancient Greek myth of Sisyphus is juxtaposed with Albert Camus's famous essay, "The Myth of Sisyphus." The literary motif of blindness and inner sight appears and reappears throughout the anthology, in fiction by Raymond Carver, in Sophocles' great drama Oedipus The King, and in excerpts from the autobiographical writing of Helen Keller. Other clusters and subthemes center on the role of a secret in relationships, the pleasures of solitude, the experience of rebirth and regeneration, the trials of being an immigrant, rites of passage, and the history and evolution of romantic love. Additional information on these thematic groupings is available. in the inside cover of Lives Through Literature and in the Instructor's Manual. INTRODUCTIONS TO THEMATIC SECTIONS </p><p> Each thematic introduction opens with a short introduction, elucidating the theme and its variations. These brief introductions can be used as a point of departure for a general discussion that will generate a more intense examination of the selections. Within each thematic section the material is arranged so that there is a progression of experience leading toward some significant moment in life. We have situated each selection within its genre to encourage it to be seen in the context of the selections that precede and follow it.

Across the millennium from 500 to 1500, distinguished historian Johannes Fried describes a dynamic confluence of political, social, religious, economic, and scientific developments that draws a guiding thread through the era: the growth of a culture of reason.</p><p>Beginning with the rise of the Franks, Fried uses individuals to introduce key themes, bringing to life those who have too often been reduced to abstractions of the medieval &#x201c;monk&#x201d; or &#x201c;knight.&#x201d; Milestones encountered in this thousand-year traversal include Europe&#x2019;s political, cultural, and religious renovation under Charlemagne; the Holy Roman Empire under Charles IV, whose court in Prague was patron to crowning cultural achievements; and the series of conflicts between England and France that made up the Hundred Years&#x2019; War and gave to history the enduringly fascinating Joan of Arc. Broader political and intellectual currents are examined, from the authority of the papacy and impact of the Great Schism, to new theories of monarchy and jurisprudence, to the rise of scholarship and science.<i></i></p><p><i>The Middle Ages</i> is full of people encountering the unfamiliar, grappling with new ideas, redefining power, and interacting with different societies. Fried gives readers an era of innovation and turbulence, of continuities and discontinuities, but one above all characterized by the vibrant expansion of knowledge and an understanding of the growing complexity of the world.</p></p><p><p>Johannes Fried was, until his retirement, Professor of Medieval History at the University of Frankfurt.</p>&#x201c;Written by one of the most original historians of his generation, this survey of western European medieval history covers the decline of Rome to the eve of the Reformation with verve and intelligence. <b>Fried</b> argues that modernity and the Enlightenment, despite having forgotten their debts to the Middle Ages, actually owe to the period their most valued characteristics: rationality, method, empiricism, doubt, modern science, global interests, citizenship, and last but not least, freedom.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Philippe Buc, University of Vienna</b><br><br>&#x201c;Thanks to what German medieval scholar <b>Fried</b> calls the cultural prejudices of such Enlightenment thinkers as Immanuel Kant, the Middle Ages got a bad rap as a &#x2018;childish and grotesque&#x2019; era when, in reality, it was a period of enormous learning, democratization and secularization... Overall, the Middle Ages brought freedom, Fried argues in this passionate but intensely scholarly book (translated from the German), and the desire to know the wider world.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This beautifully written and well-translated overview of the period between 500 and 1500 C.E. examines concepts and perceptions rather than kings and battles. <b>Fried</b>, professor of medieval history at the University of Frankfurt, begins with Boethius, whose work bridged classical and late antiquity. The development of new attitudes toward liberty and the beginnings of the division between church and state are described with a lucidity that is rare in historical overviews. Fried considers Jews, Muslims, and women as integral parts of society. He also addresses the development of natural science in the 13th century, noting that its monastic adherents had no problem with trying to discover how God&#x2019;s creation worked. The politics of absolutism are presented in the context of the nature of governance and the rise of the power of commerce. As Fried reaches the plague years of the 14th and 15th centuries and the Renaissance, he analyzes the &#x2018;eruption of the supernatural into the real world&#x2019; through new modes in art and the rise of witch hunts. Fried&#x2019;s conclusion that the &#x2018;Middle Ages...crossed seamlessly over into a similarly constituted Early Modern period&#x2019; is aimed at dispelling the myth of a &#x2018;dark&#x2019; age between antiquity and modernity.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<b>Fried</b>&#x2019;s breadth of knowledge is formidable and his passion for the period admirable...Those with a true passion for the Middle Ages will be thrilled by this ambitious <i>defensio</i>.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Dan Jones</b><b>, </b><b><i>Sunday Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Fried</b>] gets down to the business of writing excellent history in this absorbing book...Fried covers much in the realm of ideas on monarchy, jurisprudence, arts, chivalry and courtly love, millenarianism and papal power, all of it a rewarding read...The medieval period was, he argues passionately and convincingly, &#x2018;more mature and more wise, more inquisitive, inventive and with a finer feel for art,&#x2019; and its people &#x2018;more revolutionary in their deployment of reason and their thinking&#x2019; than we give them credit for.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Sean McGlynn</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[<b>Fried</b>&#x2019;s] erudite study traces our evolution towards reason, worldwide exploration, and rational procedures to a dynamic medieval period.

Murphy</b><b>, </b><b><i>PopMatters</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This <b>Johannes Fried</b> project is certainly ambitious--condensing 1,000 years of history into a coherent volume is not an easy task.

Tchen tells his story in three parts. In the first, he explores America's fascination with Asia as a source of luxury items, cultural taste, and lucrative trade. In the second, he explains how Chinese, European-Americans in Yellowface, and various caricatures became objects of curiosity in the expansive commercial marketplace. In the third part, Tchen focuses on how Americans' attitude toward the Chinese changed from fascination to demonization, leading to the passage of the Chinese Exclusion Acts beginning in 1882.</p></p><p>"New York before Chinatown is a large, ambitious, and impressive work&#x2014;one of the very best and certainly one of the most original studies of its kind."&#x2014;Lawrence Levine, George Mason University, author of The Opening of the American Mind<p>John Kuo Wei Tchen is director of Asian/Pacific/American Studies and an associate professor of history at New York University.

In 1980, Tchen cofounded the Museum of Chinese in the Americas.</p></p><h2>The Jungle: [A Graphic Novel]</h2><p><b>A compelling graphic novel adaptation of Upton Sinclair's seminal protest novel that brings to life the harsh conditions and exploited existences of immigrants in Chicago's meatpacking industry in the early twentieth century.</b><br><br>Long acclaimed around the world, Upton Sinclair's 1906 muckraking novel <i>The Jungle</i> remains a powerful book even today. Not many works of literature can boast that their publication brought about actual social and labor change, but that's just what <i>The Jungle</i> did, as it led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906. In today's society, where labor and safety of the food we eat remain key concerns for all, Sinclair's shocking story still resonates. Bringing new life and energy to this classic work, adapter and illustrator Kristina Gehrmann takes Sinclair's prose and transforms it through pen and ink, allowing you to discover (or rediscover) this book and see it from a whole new perspective.</p><p><b>Upton Sinclair</b> was an American journalist and novelist, a Pulitzer Prize winner for fiction, and author of the classic muckraking novel <i>The Jungle</i> that led to the passage of the Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906. <br><br><b>Kristina Gehrmann</b> is an illustrator and graphic novelist living and working in Hamburg and Meersbusch, Germany.

R. S., formerly Astronomer Royal<br>A model of comprehensive scholarship, <i>The History of the Telescope </i>relates not only the stories of early inventors and astronomers but also the rarely recorded details of the instruments themselves and their makers. This remarkable chronicle covers many fields, including professional and amateur astronomy, optics, glass and lens technology, and the craft of the precision instrument.<br>Author Henry C. King bases his accounts primarily on first-hand sources &#x2014; the letters, memoirs, papers, and treatises of the men who worked with telescopes. The great intellects (Roger Bacon, Galileo, Newton) and innovators (Tycho Brahe, Huygens, Hooke, Sir William Herschel) receive their due, along with lesser-known craftsmen and amateurs: the seventeenth-century Italian telescope makers Campani and Divini; the great London instrument artists Graham, Dolland, and Ramsden; and the experimenters Foucault and Brashear, whose contributions to mirror manufacture remain fundamental to all levels of astronomical endeavor. The modern-day successors of these men and their achievements bring this history to its conclusion in the mid-twentieth century, with profiles of the instruments still in use today.<br>A prime resource on the evolution of the telescope, this volume is magnificently illustrated with nearly 200 portraits, diagrams, and photographs. <br></p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Emma (Enriched Classics)</h2><p><b>ENDURING LITERATURE ILLUMINATED<br> BY PRACTICAL SCHOLARSHIP</b> <br><br> A high-spirited young woman meddles in other peoples' love lives in this classic comedy of errors set in nineteenth-century England. <br><br> <b>EACH ENRICHED CLASSIC EDITION INCLUDES:</b> <br> � A concise introduction that gives readers important background information <br> � A chronology of the author's life and work <br> � A timeline of significant events that provides the book's historical context <br> � An outline of key themes and plot points to help readers form their own interpretations <br> � Detailed explanatory notes <br> � Critical analysis, including contemporary and modern perspectives on the work <br> � Discussion questions to promote lively classroom and book group interaction <br> � A list of recommended related books and films to broaden the reader's experience <br><br> Enriched Classics offer readers affordable editions of great works of literature enhanced by helpful notes and insightful commentary.

Austen only completed six novels in her lifetime, of which five feature young women whose chances for making a good marriage depend greatly on financial issues, and whose prospects if they fail are rather grim. <i>Emma</i> is the exception: "Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her." One may be tempted to wonder what Austen could possibly find to say about so fortunate a character. The answer is, quite a lot. <p> For Emma, raised to think well of herself, has <i>such</i> a high opinion of her own worth that it blinds her to the opinions of others. The story revolves around a comedy of errors: Emma befriends Harriet Smith, a young woman of unknown parentage, and attempts to remake her in her own image. Ignoring the gaping difference in their respective fortunes and stations in life, Emma convinces herself and her friend that Harriet should look as high as Emma herself might for a husband--and she zeroes in on an ambitious vicar as the perfect match. At the same time, she reads too much into a flirtation with Frank Churchill, the newly arrived son of family friends, <i>and</i> thoughtlessly starts a rumor about poor but beautiful Jane Fairfax, the beloved niece of two genteelly impoverished elderly ladies in the village. As Emma's fantastically misguided schemes threaten to surge out of control, the voice of reason is provided by Mr. Knightly, the Woodhouse's longtime friend and neighbor. Though Austen herself described Emma as "a heroine whom no one but myself will much like," she endowed her creation with enough charm to see her through her most egregious behavior, and the saving grace of being able to learn from her mistakes. By the end of the novel Harriet, Frank, and Jane are all properly accounted for, Emma is wiser (though certainly not sadder), and the reader has had the satisfaction of enjoying Jane Austen at the height of her powers. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Emma is Austen&#39;s most technically accomplished novel, with a hidden plot, the full implications of which are only revealed by a second reading. The text presented here retains the spelling and punctuation of the first edition of 1816, allowing readers to see the novel as Austen&#39;s contemporaries first encountered it. The volume provides comprehensive explanatory notes, an extensive critical introduction, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and an authoritative textual apparatus. This edition is an indispensable resource for all scholars and readers of Austen.</p><h2>CRASH! BOOM! A Math Tale</h2><p><b>How do these blocks stack up?

Shilts doesn&#39;t stop there, wondering why more people in the gay community, the mass media and the country at large didn&#39;t stand up in anger more quickly. The AIDS pandemic is one of the most striking developments of the late 20th century and this is the definitive story of its beginnings.<p>RANDY SHILTS was one of the first journalists to recognize AIDS as an important national issue and, in the early 1980s, he began to report on AIDS full time for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, making him the only journalist to do so.

The framework for our lives, it is a source of constant change, sometimes measured and predictable, sometimes drastic, out of control. Yet what is now ubiquitous was not always so. Capitalism was an unlikely development when it emerged from isolated changes in farming, trade, and manufacturing in early-modern England. Astute observers began to notice these changes and register their effects. Those in power began to harness these new practices to the state, enhancing both. A system generating wealth, power, and new ideas arose to reshape societies in a constant surge of change.<br><br> Approaching capitalism as a culture, as a historical development that was by no means natural or inevitable, Joyce Appleby gives us a fascinating introduction to this most potent creation of mankind from its origins to its present global reach.</p><p>Advance Praise for The Relentless Revolution: &#34;Joyce Appleby&#39;s prolific historical writings on politics and economic thought have earned her a distinguished reputation for incisiveness and originality. The Relentless Revolution, a crowning achievement, shows that capitalism is as much a matter of values and ideas as of supply, demand, and balance sheets. This is sweeping, challenging historical writing of the highest order.&#34; -Sean Wilentz, Princeton University, author of The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln &#34;Joyce Appleby is one of our most distinguished historians, an elegant writer as well as an innovative and penetrating thinker. The Relentless Revolution is Appleby at her best: a brisk, fair-minded history of capitalism and its consequences.&#34; -T. J. Stiles, author of The First Tycoon: The Epic Life of Cornelius Vanderbilt &#34;Joyce Appleby, one of the leading historians of our generation, here provides the general reader with an impressively wide-ranging account and analysis of the making of the modern economic world. A fitting capstone to a distinguished career and a must-read for businesspeople.&#34; -Daniel Walker Howe, UCLA, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848 &#34;The Relentless Revolution tackles the enormous subject of the rise and expansion of modern capitalism. Starting in medieval England and ending with the global crisis that began in 2008, Appleby explores the successes and failures of capitalism over the last five hundred years and more. This readable, engaging, comprehensive account will enlighten and entertain anyone with an interest in understanding where the world economy has come from, and where it might be going.&#34; -Jeffrey Frieden, Harvard University, author of Global Capitalism: Its Fall and Rise in the Twentieth-Century WorldJoyce Appleby (1929&#x2015;2016) was a professor of history emerita at UCLA, the author of Shores of Knowledge, The Relentless Revolution, and the coauthor of Telling the Truth about History, among many other works. A former president of the American History Association, she was awarded the 2009 Arthur M.

Studying and talking about the humanities-the great works of art, literature, history, philosophy, and music of the Western tradition&#x2014;are no different. Part of becoming educated in the humanities is mastering these terms and concepts that are taken for granted by teachers and experts, so that specific works can be discussed and analyzed Without constant redefinition of basic terms and ideas. </p> <p> This handbook attempts to provide students with the most basic and general definitions of the terms and ideas that are likely to come up in introductory humanities, literature, and Western civilization courses. The words in boldface type in the text are also entries in the handbook. This book gives students a basic awareness of important terms and concepts that will facilitate other reading and save time and frustration. As such, the terms chosen are the ones that in my twenty years of teaching such courses typically stump students. Thus, the criteria of selection and emphasis obviously are to some degree subjective, and I apologize for any important terms I have omitted. </p> <p> My hope is that the students' experience with their other class texts, whether primary or secondary, and with their instructor's lectures and other class materials will be enhanced by having at hand a guide to the terms that are likely to be used when those materials are presented. These definitions, moreover, are intended to be general: They are only the first step for the student in furthering his or her understanding of these key ideas and terms. It is hoped that as class progresses and the student reads primary works and listens to lectures and analyses of ideas and themes, these general definitions will be fleshed out and elaborated. </p></p><h2>Arab Historians of the Crusades</h2><p><p>The recapture of Jerusalem, the siege of acre, the fall of Tripoli, the effect in Baghdad of events in Syria; these and other happenings were faithfully recorded by Arab historians during the two centuries of the Crusades.

This meeting launched the young French scholar on a half-century of engagement with Benjamin's work that culminated in the writing of <i>Walter Benjamin's Passages.</i><br> <br> Taking a cue from his subject, Missac adopts a form of indirect critique in which independent details examined seemingly in passing emerge over the course of the book as parts of larger patterns of understanding. The interlocked essays move among such topics as reading and writing, collecting, the dialectic, and time and history. Many of the subjects are standard in Benjamin studies, but the freshness and directness of Missac's response to them makes this book compelling.<br> <br> After the war, Missac took it on himself to make Benjamin's work more widely known in France. He published a series of translations and critical essays and this one book, which appeared just a few months after his death in 1986. Benjamin, who committed suicide at age forty-eight, has no marked grave, and in one sense <i>Walter Benjamin's Passages</i> is a <i>tombeau</i>, a poem honoring a writer's achievement that in calmer times was written for the dedication of a physical monument but now must stand in place of the absent monument. It is a work of sophisticated and imaginative criticism that shows how Benjamin's work anticipated the future and how&#x2014;as Missac's excursus on the glass atrium in the architecture of the 1980s shows&#x2014;it can be fruitfully extended.<br> <br> <i>Studies in Contemporary German Social Thought</i></p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Making Progress in Russian: A Second Year Course</h2><p>This proficiency based book helps readers expand and deepen their knowledge of Russian grammar; acquire greater command of vocabulary; and increase their ability to understand, speak and read Russian.</p><p>This proficiency based book helps readers expand and deepen their knowledge of Russian grammar; acquire greater command of vocabulary; and increase their ability to understand, speak and read Russian.

A collection such as this comes along only once in a generation, full of heartwarming tales that families will read, re-read, and remember.</p><p>Born and raised in New York City, JANE YOLEN now lives in Hatfield, Massachusetts.

After graduating from the Art Center College of Design, Ishida has had an illustrious career as an accomplished children's book illustrator. &nbsp;Her unique style has been praised for its exquisite color and design.Gr 2&#x2013;4&#x2014;Readers will appreciate this dynamically written collection of inspiring true animal stories. These quick, satisfying reads are accompanied by factual sidebars (for instance, the tale of Washoe, a chimp who was taught sign language by scientists, also contains material on Nim Chimpsky, another chimpanzee who learned language). The authors have selected 19 tales, including the story of famed racehorse Seabiscuit; Keiko, the orca featured in the film Free Willy; Greyfriar's Bobby, a terrier who mourned at his owner's gravesite for years; Owen and Mzee, respectively a hippopotamus and a tortoise in Kenya who bonded during the tsunami; and Lonesome George, a tortoise who was the last of his subspecies. The gentle, digitally enhanced acrylic illustrations are attractive, though they lean toward the saccharine. One story recounts how sled dogs, including Balto, carried medicine through a treacherous snowstorm to save the children of Nome, AK, from life-threatening diphtheria; however, the art depicts doggy smiles, light snow, and an easy terrain. The back matter is valuable, including a map pinpointing the animals' locations, a chronology, character listing, and an author's note. Readers will enjoy this compendium and may even be motivated to seek out additional information on their favorites.&#x2014;Nancy Call, Santa Cruz Public Libraries, Aptos, CA</p><h2>Echoes of the Civil War: Capturing Battlefields through a Pinhole Camera</h2><p><p><strong>A fresh and surprising look at the American Civil War through pinhole camera photographs of sesquicentennial battlefield reenactments</strong></p> In 2011, Michael Falco set out to document the American Civil War's 150th anniversary by photographing reenactments of more than 20 major battles&#x2015;from the First Manassas, Antietam, and Chancellorsville to Gettysburg, Vicksburg, and Appomattox. But rather than shooting these historic re-creations in high-definition, Falco opted for a different, older medium: a pinhole camera. This antebellum photographic technology, shot from an on-the-ground perspective, captures these battlefields in a way that feels more &#x201c;real&#x201d; and fully realized than even the famous daguerrotypes made during the war itself. In Falco's transporting photographs, the smoke-filled battle reenactments become blurred and dreamlike, echoing the sentiments found in the actual letters and journals of soldiers who fought and died there. Throughout, historical photographs from the period offer context to the modern-day re-creations, showing just how much&#x2015;or how little&#x2015;has changed on this hallowed ground. One hundred and fifty years after the last soldier fell, <em>Echoes of the Civil War</em> provides beautiful and compelling evidence of a Civil War landscape that is, literally and metaphorically, still with us.<br> 150 color photographs</p><p>Michael Falco is an award-winning photojournalist who lives and works in New York City. A regular contributor to The New York Times and National Geographic, Falco&#x2019;s previous books include Along Martin Luther King: Travels on Black America&#x2019;s Main Street. Many of his images are on permanent display in the 9/11 Memorial Museum, and his panoramic work documenting the Fresh Kills Landfill is in the permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art.&#x201c; <p>A Civil War enthusiast since his childhood, photographer Michael Falco set out on a four-year, battlefield-to-battlefield odyssey coinciding with the war&#x2019;s 150th anniversary. The result is the wonderfully haunting Echoes of the Civil War: Capturing Battlefields through a Pinhole Camera (Countryman Press, $35, 288 pages, ISBN 9781581573800). &#x201c;Soldiers&#x2019; journals and memoirs describe the battlefields as dream-like,&#x201d; Falco writes, &#x201c;and that is how they appear through the patient eye of the pinhole camera.&#x201d; While exploring major battle sites from Bull Run to Appomattox, Falco became not just a chronicler but a re-enactor himself, dressing in period clothing as he set up his primitive wooden box camera, using modern film but no lens, viewfinder or shutter. Along with these evocative photos, Falco interweaves past and present through his narrative as he &#x201c;tumbled down the rabbit hole of Civil War history.&#x201d; Echoes of the Civil War will hold great appeal for history and photography buffs alike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p> &#x201d;<br> - <strong>Bookpage</strong></p><h2>Collins Portuguese dictionary: English-Portuguese, Portuguese-English,</h2><p>This dictionary has been expanded and updated to provide increased contemporary coverage of both Brazilian and Peninsular Portuguese.

It is a full cast production with sounds effects and original music at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. <p>Duration is approximately 1 hour.</p>First published in 1895, America&#39;s greatest novel of the Civil War was written before 21-year-old Stephen Crane had &#34;smelled even the powder of a sham battle.&#34; But this powerful psychological study of a young soldier&#39;s struggle with the horrors, both within and without, that war strikes the reader with its undeniable realism and with its masterful descriptions of the moment-by-moment riot of emotions felt by me under fire. Ernest Hemingway called the novel an American classic, and Crane&#39;s genius is as much apparent in his sharp, colorful prose as in his ironic portrayal of an episode of war so intense, so immediate, so real that the terror of battle becomes our own ... in a masterpiece so unique that many believe modern American fiction began with Stephen Crane.</p><h2>Home Is Where the Wind Blows: Chapters from a Cosmologist&#39;s Life</h2><p>One of this century&#39;s most eminent scientist offers a revealing and charming account of his life and work. Mathematician, physicist, astronomer, cosmologist and originator of the term the &#39;Big Bang&#39;-Sir Fred has always been ready and able to challenge established thinking.</p><p>Sir Fred Hoyle was a lecturer in mathematics (1945-1956) and Plumian professor of astronomy and experimental philosophy (1958-1972) at Cambridge.Hoyle (The Intelligent Universe, 1983, etc.) is never dull. You may disagree with his latest theories; you may take issue with his interpretation of past events; but he is ever the lively protagonist here, telling the story of a life in which he has seen much of the world and discoursed with the prime movers of science. As if to underscore that the child is father to the man, Hoyle begins his story with details of growing up poor in rural Yorkshire and how he did his best to avoid school while at the same time teaching himself to read and do arithmetic. In due course he won scholarships that eventually led to Cambridge, where he stayed for 39 years, accumulating wonderful stories and numerous colleagues who were the movers and shakers of 20th-century theoretical physics. Hoyle describes the chain of events that led to his major contributions in nucleosynthesis--how the elements are formed in stars and supernovas. He also provides details of his radar work in WW II and later snippets about his mathematical creativity, but these are rather compressed in relation to the life. Hoyle eventually resigned from the chair in astronomy he held because of a dispute that had become a bureaucratic nightmare. By this time the reader is well prepared for the backbiting and partisanship that make government science and academic politics anything but genteel and impartial, and Hoyle is ever ready to tell it like it is. He reserves for a final chapter his cosmology theory, which is no surprise: Down with the Big Bang and up with the continuous creation, with the universe perhaps as the manifestation of God.

These handwritten manuscripts, often richly illustrated, included remedies for such common maladies as "sore of the head" and "pestilence," as well as for more unusual afflications like "demoniacal possession." In addition, they offered recipes for love potions, mouthwashes, dyes, antiseptic ointments, and other concoctions, and provided practical instructions on how to gather and store herbs.</p> <p><i>A Medieval Herbal</i> reveals the extraordinary diversity of these ancient documents and shows them to be amusing, surprising, and often instructive.

The author responds to the challenge by introducing her own &#34;commognitive&#34; conceptualization of human thinking. She argues for this special approach with the help of examples of mathematical thinking. Except for its contribution to theorizing on human development, the book is relevant to researchers looking for methodological innovations, and to mathematics educators seeking pedagogical insights and improvements.</p><p>This book argues for the approach to thinking about thinking by looking at communication and cognition, or &#34;commognition.&#34; She argues for this approach by using examples from mathematical education and human development. The explanatory power of commognitive framework and the manner in which it contributes to our understanding of human development is illustrated through analysis of mathematical discourse accompanied by vignettes from mathematics classrooms.Anna Sfard&#39;s research focuses on the development of mathematical discourses in individual lives and in the course of history. In a series of studies in Israel, Canada, and the United States, she has been investigating the development of mathematical thinking in both history and individual learning. Results of these studies, both theoretical and empirical, have been published in more than 100 articles and edited volumes, many of which have been widely cited. The recipient of the 2007 Freudhental Medal for research in mathematics education, she is a Professor of Mathematics Education at the University of Haifa, the first holder of the Lappan-Phillips-Fitzgerald endowed chair in Michigan State University, and a Visiting Professor at the Institute of Education in London.</p><h2>In Giacometti&#x2019;s Studio</h2><p><p><b>A keenly and personally observed record of how a place can be so identified with an artist and so evocative of his life&#x2019;s work that it becomes his single greatest achievement</b><br><br> This deeply engaging book introduces the reader to the creative chaos of the tiny Parisian studio of the great sculptor Alberto Giacometti, from the moment he and his brother, Diego, arrived in 1927, with all their possessions in a wheelbarrow, until Alberto&#x2019;s death in 1966. Michael Peppiatt relates how the artist first worked there as a member of the Surrealist movement and then how he gradually made his mark on Paris&#x2019;s artistic, literary, and intellectual worlds. After an enforced wartime exile in Geneva in a miserable hotel, he returned to Paris and to the same broken-down little shed of a studio behind Montparnasse where he struggled to realize his pared-down vision of mankind and which became a magnet for many of the great artists and writers of the time (from Picasso and Braque to Balthus, from Breton and Genet to Beckett). Peppiatt prefaces his story with a poignant, personal narrative of how as a young man he arrived in Paris with an introduction from Francis Bacon to Giacometti; the encounter was forestalled by the artist&#x2019;s very recent death, but Peppiatt instead got to know the key people in Giacometti&#x2019;s world. He explains how the studio, now dismantled, seems to be both Giacometti&#x2019;s most important artwork, encompassing countless complete or unfinished works, and the archive of years of struggle. With Giacometti&#x2019;s death, it became his greatest achievement, containing as it did the traces of a lifetime&#x2019;s search for truth. This vivid exploration of one of the most evocative and influential spaces in 20th-century art connects us with both a unique career and an entire, outstanding moment in French culture.</p></p><p><b>Michael Peppiatt</b> is a leading authority on Giacometti and Francis Bacon.

This book is an attempt to provide a systematic account of the way in which this somatosensory system works. The properties of the peripheral receptors have been debated in scientific terms for about a century and the resolu� tion of the conflict in favour of the existence of &#39;specific&#39; receptors for mechanical, thermal and noxious stimuli is reported and discussed in the opening chapters of the book. An awareness of this specificity has forced a re-consideration of the ways in which the central nervous system de-codes the information which is showered upon it. Advances in knowledge of the fine structure of the central nervous system have raised functional questions about the operation and organisation of the sensory systems in the spinal cord and brain. Fresh insight into the morphological complexity of the dorsal horn and higher levels of the nervous system gives the physiologist a clearer idea of the units with which he works. Progress has been made in understanding the function of sensory relay nuclei in general and indivi� dual tracts in particular and is fully decomented.</p><p></p><h2>The Greek-English New Testament: UBS 5th Revised Edition and NIV</h2><p><p>The most widely used edition of the Greek New Testament and the most widely read contemporary English Bible translation are now available in one volume!

This Native American mathematics can best be described by considering the nature of the concepts found in a variety of individual New World cultures. Unlike modern mathematics in which numbers and concepts are expressed in a universal mathematical notation, the numbers and concepts found in native cultures occur and are expressed in many distinctive ways. Native American Mathematics, edited by Michael P. Closs, is the first book to focus on mathematical development indigenous to the New World.</p><p>Spanning time from the prehistoric to the present, the thirteen essays in this volume attest to the variety of mathematical development present in the Americas. The data are drawn from cultures as diverse as the Ojibway, the Inuit (Eskimo), and the Nootka in the north; the Chumash of Southern California; the Aztec and the Maya in Mesoamerica; and the Inca and Jibaro of South America. Among the strengths of this collection are this diversity and the multidisciplinary approaches employed to extract different kinds of information.

He is regarded as one of the greatest in the canon of world literature. His best known works are War and Peace (1869) and Anna Karenina (1877). He first achieved literary acclaim in his 20s with the semi-autobiographical trilogy, Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth (1852&#x2013;1856), and Sevastopol Sketches(1855), the latter based upon his experiences in the Crimean War. Tolstoy's fiction includes dozens of short stories and several novellas such as The Death of Ivan Ilyich, Family Happiness, and Hadji Murad. He also wrote plays and numerous philosophical essays. In the 1870s Tolstoy experienced a moral crisis, followed by what he regarded as a profound spiritual awakening, as outlined in his non-fiction work A Confession. His literal interpretation of the ethical teachings of Jesus, centering on the Sermon on the Mount, caused him to become a fervent Christian anarchist and pacifist. His new-found asceticism and determination to renounce his considerable wealth tipped his marriage into turmoil, which continued right up to his death at the age of 82, in the waiting room of an, until then, obscure Russian railway station. Tolstoy's ideas on nonviolent resistance, expressed in such works as The Kingdom of God Is Within You, were to have a significant impact on such pivotal 20th-century figures as Mohandas Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., and James Bevel.</p><h2>Derivatives Markets (2nd Edition)</h2><p>Derivatives Markets presents a comprehensive and in-depth treatment of futures, options, and other derivatives in a mathematically accessible and intuitive manner.

Cudd argues that the explanation lies in the coercive co-opting of the oppressed to join in their own oppression. This answer sets the stage for analysis throughout the book, as it explores the questions of how and why the oppressed join in their oppression. Cudd argues that oppression is an institutionally structured harm perpetrated on social groups by other groups using direct and indirect material, economic, and psychological force. Among the most important and insidious of the indirect forces is an economic force that operates through oppressed persons' own rational choices. This force constitutes the central feature of analysis, and the book argues that this force is especially insidious because it conceals the fact of oppression from the oppressed and from others who would be sympathetic to their plight. The oppressed come to believe that they suffer personal failings and this belief appears to absolve society from responsibility. <br>While on Cudd's view oppression is grounded in material exploitation and physical deprivation, it cannot be long sustained without corresponding psychological forces. Cudd examines the direct and indirect psychological forces that generate and sustain oppression. She discusses strategies that groups have used to resist oppression and argues that all persons have a moral responsibility to resist in some way. In the concluding chapter Cudd proposes a concept of freedom that would be possible for humans in a world that is actively opposing oppression, arguing that freedom for each individual is only possible when we achieve freedom for all others.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ann E.

They decide to give Anne a home anyway, and find that she fills their hearts and lives with love and adventure. Lucy Maud Montgomery wrote the story for all ages, and it has remained a favorite among adults and children through the years. Full-color illustrations help you envision Anne&#39;s woes about her red hair and the beauty she observes in eastern Canada. The cloth-bound cover with a full-color illustrated plate and beautiful foil stamping are sure to make this a favorite among your home library titles.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

All five of Baptist Health Care's hospitals have spent multiple years in the top one percent in patient satisfaction based on survey results from the largest hospital patient database in the world. In 2004, President George W. Bush awarded the company the coveted Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award. But Baptist Health Care was not always a success story. </p><p>In 1995, Al Stubblefield and his management team had to face some harsh realities: patient satisfaction rating had reached an all-time low; recent corporate reengineering efforts had damaged employee morale; and five years of merger discussions with three different organizations further devastated morale. Al's suspicions were confirmed when an attitude survey conducted among his employees made it abundantly clear: they were not pleased with the Baptist Health Care experience. In addition to the internal conflicts, their flagship hospital was competing against two other facilities owned by national health care conglomerates with bigger budgets and deeper pockets. Outspending them was simply not possible. </p><p>This is the story about how one company beat the odds and rebounded to become a leader in its field and a pioneer in management. By creating a cultural transformation within their Baptist Health Care organization, employees became engaged and inspired to perform at the highest levels. Their positive outlook translated into a level of service and operational excellence that has become the national benchmark. Through their story, you too will learn how to transform your organization into a WOW! culture with a passion for excellence.</p></p><h2>Who Governs?: Presidents, Public Opinion, and Manipulation (Chicago Studies in American Politics)</h2><p><p>America&#x2019;s model of representational government rests on the premise that elected officials respond to the opinions of citizens. This is a myth, however, not a reality, according to James N. Druckman and Lawrence R. Jacobs. In <i>Who Governs?</i>, Druckman and Jacobs combine existing research with novel data from US presidential archives to show that presidents make policy by largely ignoring the views of most citizens in favor of affluent and well-connected political insiders. Presidents treat the public as pliable, priming it to focus on personality traits and often ignoring it on policies that fail to become salient.<br> <br> Melding big debates about democratic theory with existing research on American politics and innovative use of the archives of three modern presidents&#x2014;Johnson, Nixon, and Reagan&#x2014;Druckman and Jacobs deploy lively and insightful analysis to show that the conventional model of representative democracy bears little resemblance to the actual practice of American politics. The authors conclude by arguing that polyarchy and the promotion of accelerated citizen mobilization and elite competition can improve democratic responsiveness. An incisive study of American politics and the flaws of representative government, this book will be warmly welcomed by readers interested in US politics, public opinion, democratic theory, and the fecklessness of American leadership and decision-making.</p></p><p><b>James N. Druckman</b> is the Payson S. Wild Professor of Political Science and Faculty Fellow at the Institute for Policy Research at Northwestern University and an honorary professor of political science at Aarhus University in Denmark.&#x201c;<i>Who Governs?</i> is a very significant contribution to our understanding of how presidents do not simply respond to public opinion but participate in crafting it. A breakthrough.&#x201d; (Lisa Disch, University of Michigan)<br><br>"This fascinating study, based on confidential documents from three US presidents, sheds new light on the relationship between America&#x2019;s political elites and its citizens. The picture is not pretty: presidents of both political parties seek to manipulate, distract, and often mislead the public in their pursuit of narrow interests that do not benefit the majority of citizens. A compelling, important, and sobering account that underscores just how far America has drifted from the democratic ideal of a government of, by, and for the people." (Martin Gilens, Princeton University)<br><br>"Just how responsive is the president to the public? In theory, we all hope very, but increasingly we worry that presidents have grown more distant from the wishes of the public. In <i>Who Governs</i>?, we get an empirical answer to that question that is at once novel and also deeply disturbing." (<i>Heath Brown, New Books in Political Science</i> 2015-05-22)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Who Governs?</i> is an exploration of presidents, public opinion, and manipulation. Druckman and Jacobs make the case that presidents from both Republican and Democratic parties mainly serve and are guided by the wishes of the wealthy and political elites and exploit public opinion in order to serve those ends.&#x201d; (<i>Talking Points Memo</i> 2015-06-03)<br><br>&#x201c;Druckman and Jacobs&#x2019;s <i>Who Governs?</i> is notable in that it offers a rich and complex view on the process of representation in democratic society, one that takes seriously the notion of elite influence over public opinion and that provides compelling evidence that unequal representation exists because of the conscious, strategic actions of political elites. This represents a significant step forward in understanding both why representational biases continue to exist in American politics, and how we might remedy them.&#x201d; (<i>Public Opinion Quarterly</i> 2016-04-25)<br><br>&#x201c;An impressive, thought-provoking work. . . . Druckman and Jacobs skillfully examine how modern presidents have made use of yet another technological advance: sophisticated public opinion polling. . . . The lasting contribution of this book is that it wipes away any romanticized or theoretical notions about how the presidency functions in the American political system. Presidents (at least, the ones considered in the book, but is there any doubt that later ones are doing the same thing with even greater intensity?) are out to get their way. And they now have a tool&#x2014;polling&#x2014;that gives them insights into what works and what doesn&#x2019;t.&#x201d; (<i>Congress and the Presidency</i> 2016-04-25)<br><br>&#x201c;Druckman and Jacobs ask a question that speaks to the fundamental nature of American democracy: How responsive is the government to public opinion?&nbsp;. . . The authors convincingly show that rather than responding to the wishes of ordinary Americans, presidents routinely seek to distract large swaths of voters from important issues, and perhaps even more disturbingly, disingenuously convince them that what is good for the most affluent and well-connected Americans is also good for them.&nbsp; This persuasive book presents a sobering view of a broken political system that serves the interests of only the narrowest slice of Americans. . . .

One brother has been sleeping for almost seven years, waking only to use the bathroom and eat a meal. Another savagely defends the household from women. Serag, the youngest, is the only member of the family interested in getting a job. But even he &#x2015; try as he might &#x2015; has a hard time resisting the call of laziness.</p><p><p><strong>Albert Cossery</strong> (1913&#x2013;2008) was an Egyptian-born French novelist. Among his works are <em>The Colors of Infamy</em>, A Splendid Conspiracy, and <em>The House of Certain Death</em>, all published by New Directions.</p><p><strong>William Goyen</strong> was an American writer, most known for his novel, <em>The House of Breath</em>.</p><p><strong>Henry Miller</strong> (1891&#x2015;1980) was one of the most controversial American novelists during his lifetime. His book, <em>The Tropic of Cancer</em>, was banned in the some U.S. states before being overruled by the Supreme Court. New Directions publishes several of his books.</p><p><strong>Anna Della Subin</strong> is the author of Not Dead But Sleeping (2017). Her work has also appeared in the London Review of Books, The New York Times, and The White Review, among other places. She is a contributing editor at Bidoun.</p>&#x201c;Despite the seemingly unrelieved gloom and futility in which his figures move, Cossery nevertheless expresses in every work the indomitable faith in the power of people to throw off the yoke.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Henry Miller</strong></p><h2>Games of Life: Explorations in Ecology, Evolution, and Behaviour</h2><p>Life is often a matter of gambles, pay-offs, and trade-offs, just like a game. This book takes readers on a tour through the games and computer simulations that are actually helping to advance knowledge in such fields as ecology, evolution, and animal behavior. Although the book deals with questions of vital importance, like sex and survival, it does so in the lively, entertaining spirit of game-playing. It starts with artificial life and self-replicating automata, a topic ideally suited for a computer-games approach. The book goes on to study pursuit games between predators and prey, and chaotic motion and its role in ecology. Games of chance and statistical paradoxes illuminate the randomness in molecular evolution, while some bizarre double games played by chromosomes help explain the laws of population genetics. Other topics include courtship, ownership, partnership, and brinksmanship-illustrated through the game of poker and computer tournaments. No other book explains so well why scientific observations and insights can be structured as the rules of a survival game, and what happens when they are assembled on a computer or in the mind and allowed to run their course. General readers as well as professionals and students in ecological, evolutionary, and behavioral studies will find this a fascinating and informative work.</p><p>&#39;an excellent introduction to what theoretical bioliogists get up to in trying to understand evolutionary and ecological ideas&#39; Andrew Pomiankowski, University College, London, Nature, Vol. 370, 1994 &#39;I would place Sigmund&#39;s book somehwere between good and excellent ... The informal style of the book is brilliant ... the book is a success.&#39; A. Kondrashov, Cornell University, TREE, vol. 9, no. 3, 1994 &#39;Karl Sigmund&#39;s Games of Life is a beautifully written and, considering its relative brevity, amazingly comprehensive survey of past and current thinking in &#34;mathematical&#34; evolution. Just as games (at least, the human variety) are supposed to be fun, so too is Games of Life - the witty section headings, the relaxed style and the clarity of the explanations make the book as enjoyable to read as a Marx Brothers film (to which there is a reference in the book) is to watch.&#39; Times Higher Education Supplement</p><h2>Italianissimo Intermediate</h2><p>Tying in with a BBC 2 series, this is the second stage of a multimedia language course for beginners learning Italian.

It presents a truly "balanced" treatment, not in the sense of treating creationism as a legitimate scientific theory (it demonstrably is not), but in the sense of dividing the blame for the controversy equally between creationists and scientists--the former for subscribing to various forms of anti-intellectualism, the latter for discounting science education and presenting science as scientism to the public and the media. The central part of the book focuses on a series of creationist fallacies (aimed at showing errors of thought, not at deriding) and of mistakes by scientists and science educators. The last part of the book discusses long-term solutions to the problem, from better science teaching at all levels to the necessity of widespread understanding of how the brain works and why people have difficulties with critical thinking.<br></p><p><br><strong>Massimo Pigliucci</strong> is Chair of the Department of Philosophy at CUNY: Lehman College.

Learning, discovery, excitement, relevance, ownership: These words describe the writer's initial motives for writing. Without human curiosity and the desire to learn, rhetoric collapses into mere terminology. By giving primacy to writer's purposes and processes for reading and writing, <i>Purpose and Process: A Reader for Writers</i> encourages writers to take control of their reading and writing of texts. </p> <p> Three basic assumptions inform the structure of <i>Purpose and Process.</i> First, rhetorical readers should be organized by purpose, not by strategy. Purpose and Process follows the sequence of purposes set forth in <i>The Prentice Hall Guide for College Writers,</i> sixth edition. In both texts, the writer's purpose (to explain, evaluate, argue, or explore a subject for a specific audience in a defined context) is the ultimate guide. Strategies (definition, comparison-contrast, process analysis, classification) are subordinated to the writer's overall purpose. The strategies help writers invent and shape ideas, but they rarely control the writing situation. Writers should be encouraged to choose among strategies to achieve a purpose for a given audience. Just as writers select an appropriate voice or choose a formal or informal style, they should be able to choose rhetorical strategies that are appropriate for the writing situation. </p> <p> Second, rhetorical readers should demonstrate that both writing and reading are active, constructive activities. Most teachers recognize that the process of writing is active and constructive, but too often they either ignore the transactive nature of reading or assume that comprehension is merely a matter of close reading. Writers need to learn how readers actively make meaning from texts even as texts are acting upon them. Writers learning to read actively should begin not with the text but with an understanding of their own experiences, ideas, and attitudes; they need to interact with other readers' interpretations as they read and reread; and they need to see how readers rely on their own experience and on prediction as they construct meaning in texts. As part of their interaction with texts, experienced writers and readers also reconstruct the rhetorical situation. Who is writing for whom? What is the occasion? What is the writer's purpose? Most important, writers and readers need to connect what they learn as active readers to their own writing: What do their readers know or believe? What are their readers' expectations? What strategies encourage readers to read actively? </p> <p> To demonstrate how reading and writing are mutually supportive, <i>Purpose and Process</i> uses prereading journal assignments, reader-response activities, and collaborative annotations of texts as means to achieve active, critical reading and effective writing. It asks students to compare what they know before they read an essay with what they learn during the reading of an essay. It asks students to respond to other readers' interpretations. It asks students to construct rhetorical situations for the texts they read and the texts they write. The traditional reading/writing model invariably asks students to read the essays and <i>then</i> write. The apparatus in <i>Purpose and Process</i> asks students to write and talk <i>before</i> and <i>during</i> reading in order to make reading (and writing) more active and interactive. Prereading and collaborative response are as crucial to the reading process as prewriting and group activities are to the writing process. </p> <p> A rhetorical reader should provide a diverse range of essays, including mainstream and minority authors, multicultural perspectives, and a range of topics and writing levels. <i>Purpose and Process,</i> fifth edition, retains from earlier editions a sampling of familiar, mainstream writers such as Annie Dillard, Donald M. Murray, Peter Elbow, Ellen Goodman, Stephen King, Lance Morrow, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Mark Twain, but it adds 17 new professional essays, 10 of which were published in the last two years. The new selections include a casebook of five essays on various facets of the school voucher debate illustrating how current controversies have multiple possible points of view. In addition, the voices of women continue to be strongly represented: Julia Alvarez, Lois Smith Brady, Annie Dillard, Gretel Ehrlich, Sandra Feldman, Ellen Goodman, Ariel Gore, Jeanne Wakatsuke Houston, Anne Lamott, Margaret Lazarus, Gloria Naylor, Katha Pollitt, Emily Prager, Amy Tan, and Deborah Tannen. </p> <p> Finally, <i>Purpose and Process</i> features a range of writing levels and styles. It has the formal, elaborate arguments of James Rachels, Edward Koch, and Martin Luther King, Jr., but it also has short, informal pieces by Gretel Ehrlich, William Least HeatMoon, and Bud Herron. <i>Purpose and Process</i> also represents the voices and the writing processes of a dozen different student writers. Their essay topics range from experiences in biology laboratory classes to essays on battered women and drunk driving. These essays illustrate a variety of strategies, from narrative essays based on personal experience to formal arguments supported by research materials. </p> <p> The following are key features of <i>Purpose and Process: A Reader for Writers:</i> </p> <p> <b> <i>Introductory Chapters on Reading and Writing:</i></b><i> </i> Since writers need to understand basic approaches to reading and writing, Chapters I and 2 introduce students to critical reading and textual annotation and to the various purposes and processes for writing. Essays in these chapters by professional and student writers illustrate active, constructive approaches to reading and writing. </p> <p> <b> <i>Purposes for Writing.</i></b><i> </i> <i>Purpose and Process</i> follows a logical sequence of purposes. Chapters 3-5 (Observing, Remembering, and Investigating) model the descriptive, narrative, and research skills students need to write their essays. Chapters 6-9 (Explaining, Evaluating, Problem Solving, and Arguing) illustrate how professional and student writers write expository and argumentative prose for a variety of audiences and situations. </p> <p> <b> <i>Processes for Writing.</i></b><i> </i> Writing processes vary from one writer to the next and from one situation to the next. Essays by Donald M. Murray, Mike Rose, and Julia Alvarez illustrate that writing processes are dependent upon the writer's culture and experience, the purpose, the audience, and the writing situation. <i>Purpose and Process</i> focuses on basic writing stages or dimensions (collecting, shaping, drafting, revising) and illustrates the individual processes of nine student writers. </p> <p> <b> <i>Critical Reading and Text Annotation.</i></b><i> </i> The first reading selection in Chapters 3-9 contains examples of responses to a Prereading Journal Entry as well as a collaboratively annotated professional essay. Both the sample prereading responses and the annotations are written by actual student writers. </p> <p> <b> <i>Thematic Clusters of Essays.</i></b><i> </i> <i>Purpose and Process</i> contains eight clusters of essay subjects: Contemporary Issues, Cultural Critique, Education, The Environment, Friends and Family, Gender Issues, Language and Literacy, and Technology, Media, and Popular Culture. See the alternate Thematic Table of Contents for a list of essays. </p> <p> <b> <i>Essay Review Questions.</i></b><i> </i> Following each student and professional essay are study questions organized into four categories: </p> <p> Questions about Meaning, Questions about Purpose and Strategy, Questions about Audience and Language, and Questions for Discussion and Writing. These questions, however, are designed to supplement rather than direct or preempt the student's individual and collaborative readings. </p> <p> <b> <i>Instructor's Resource Manual.</i></b><i> </i> This instructor's manual focuses on strategies for teaching: how to use Prereading Journals, Write-to-Learn Activities, Collaborative Annotation Groups, and a variety of Reading/Writing Activities. In addition, the manual contains suggested responses to the questions for analysis and discussion that follow each selection. </p> <p> <b> <i>New to the Fifth Edition.</i></b><i> </i> The fifth edition of <i>Purpose and Process</i> has been expanded to include several new sections and features. A new Research Appendix on conducting research and documenting sources guides the writer from research plan, to gathering sources, citing sources in text (while avoiding plagiarism), and using MLA documentation. Next, a section on summarizing academic texts and writing responses has been added to the critical reading strategies provided in Chapter 1, "Reading." To complement the sections on summarizing and responding, several graphic images, artwork, advertisements, and cartoons have been added to the fifth edition that help students practice reading and responding to visual texts. Finally, Chapter 9, "Arguing," now explains three kinds of argument: the traditional debate-style argument, Rogerian argument, and constructive argument. While traditional argument has its place, more and more teachers want to have their students go beyond adversarial argument and examine the multiple points of view behind most controversial topics. To that end, Rogerian argument encourages writers to open the lines of communication by reducing confrontation, and constructive argument encourages writers to see multiple "sides" or points of view in complex issues before recommending a possible solution. </p> <p> I wish to thank students and their teachers from colleges across the country who have submitted their work for possible publication in the fifth edition of <i>Purpose and Process.</i> Their drafts and essays taught me once more that writing is a wonderful, liberating, frustrating, creative, tedious, imaginative, and personally rewarding activity. </p> <p> The talented professionals at Prentice Hall have made publishing <i>Purpose and Process</i> not only possible but intellectually stimulating and personally enjoyable. I wish to thank Phil Miller, Gina Sluss, Brandy Dawson, Leah Jewell, Corey Good, Fran Daniele, John Ragozzine, and Karen Schultz. I also wish to thank my colleagues at Colorado State University for providing professional inspiration at every turn&#x2014;Mike Palmquist, Kate Kiefer, Sarah Sloane, Laura Thomas, Paul Barribeau, Kerri Eglin, Sue Doe, Stephanie Wardrop, Liz Warner, Bev Atchison, Bob White, Trish Taylor, and Anne Gogela.

The book shows that, around the time of Jesus' birth, there came into being a conception of "catastrophic" messianism in which the suffering, humiliation, and death of the messiah were regarded as an integral part of the redemptive process. <br><br>Scholars have long argued that Jesus could not have foreseen his suffering, death, and resurrection because the concept of a slain savior who rises from the dead was alien to the Judaism of his time. But, on the basis of hymns found at Qumran among the Dead Sea Scrolls, Knohl argues that, one generation before Jesus, a messianic leader arose in the Qumran sect who was regarded by his followers as ushering in an era of redemption and forgiveness. This messianic leader was killed by Roman soldiers in the course of a revolt that broke out in Jerusalem in 4 B.C.E. The Romans forbade his body to be buried and after the third day his disciples believed that he was resurrected and rose to heaven. This formed the basis for Jesus' messianic consciousness, Knohl argues; it was because of this model that Jesus anticipated he would suffer, die, and be resurrected after three days. <br><br>Knohl takes his fascinating inquiry one step further by suggesting that this messiah was a figure known to us from historical sources of the period. This identification may shed new light on the mystery of the "Paraclete" in the Gospel of John. A pathbreaking study, <i>The Messiah before Jesus</i> will reshape our understanding of Christianity and its relationship to Judaism.</p><p>"This is a very significant, original, and daring book. It illuminates an important era in the history of the Jewish people as well as the background of Christianity, making full use of the new Qumran material."&#x2015;Professor Emanuel Tov, Editor-in-Chief, Dead Sea Scrolls Publication Project <br><br>"The importance of this thesis for the understanding and interpretation of the historical Jesus is something of which all students of Christian Origins should take careful note. The book places a square challenge before those persuaded by a less apocalyptic/messianc view of the man and his times. I am convinced this book will become a pioneering classic in terms of the slot it fills in the field."&#x2015;James D. Tabor, author of <i>Why Waco?</i> <br><br>"This is a work of very high quality. . . . Knohl convincingly points out the historical event of a Messiah who predated the more famous one, Jesus Christ. . . . This is one of the most fascinating findings regarding the history of Jewish Messianism and the understanding of the emergence of Christianity. . . I am confident that it will mark a new phase in research of ancient Judaism."&#x2015;Moshe Idel, author of <i>Messianic Mystics</i><br><br>"This tiny book will turn many heads. Israel Knohl sifts through a vast range of ancient texts in order to weave together a new chapter in the story of Jewish Messianism."&#x2015;Gary A. Anderson, Professor of Hebrew Bible, Harvard University <br><br>"Israel Knohl established himself as a first-rate scholar with his first book, <i>The Sanctuary of Silence,</i> on a classic problem of Pentateuchal studies. Here he ventures into entirely different territory and displays impressive erudition not only in the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Talmud but also in classical antiquity. His bold and provocative theories are sure to elicit a storm of controversy."&#x2015;John J. Collins, author of <i>Between Athens and Jerusalem: Jewish Identity in the Hellenistic Diaspora and Jewish Wisdom in Helleniatic Age</i><br><br>"Fascinating. . . .Knohl's book is an original piece of research that defies some of the most solid beliefs of our time".&#x2015;Avraham Burg, Chairman of the Keneset (Israeli Parliament).<b>Israel Knohl </b>teaches at the Bible department of the Hebrew University, Jerusalem.

Taylor McGuire, a hardworking single mom with a Ph.D. in psychology, believes that compatibility is the key to a successful marriage. Bestselling relationship guru Jonathan Kirby believes it&#39;s sexual chemistry. So when these two former lovers meet up on national TV, it&#39;s more than just a difference of expert opinion that sets the sparks flying between them. And when Taylor puts forth her theory on love, Jonathan can&#39;t help but challenge: &#34;Want to bet?&#34; So begins an unconventional contest -- forty couples involved in a monthlong mock marriage for a chance to win one million dollars -- which puts Taylor&#39;s and Jonathan&#39;s professional reputations on the line.

Visit her Web site at www.SusanMallery.com.<p><b>Chapter One</b><br> </p><p> "We have a surprise for you, Taylor," Katrina Melon said in her oh-so-perky voice. </p><p> Taylor McGuire blinked at the fifty-something cable-show host and forced herself to speak, despite the fact that her throat was closing tight enough to snap steel. "No," she managed, then licked dry lips. "No surprises." </p><p> Katrina, in her too-pink Chanel suit, with her styled white-blond hair and perfectly made-up, taut features, leaned forward and patted her hand. "You'll be fine," she murmured soothingly. </p><p> <i>Oh, yeah, right,</i> Taylor thought, desperately searching for the humor in the situation. Her palms regularly went from damp to dripping, while her legs trembled -- even though she was sitting down. If this was fine, she couldn't wait to experience anxious or even panicked. The good news was she could now say she'd had a near-death moment and survived. The bad news was that she was seconds away from making a complete fool of herself in front of millions of viewers, including her friends and family back home in Texas. </p><p> Katrina put down her notes and smiled again, sort of -- with her tight skin it was hard to tell. "All set?" </p><p> Taylor didn't answer. What was the point? The plastic princess would dismiss any protests she made. Instead she concentrated on her breathing, trying to ignore the fact that <i>Psychology in the News</i> was a well-respected national cable show produced in New York. Professional cable, not badly done cable access with strange people and grainy pictures. Actual doctors and professors and cutting-edge psychologists watched the show, participated in the debates and wrote papers about subjects discussed. Taylor herself rarely missed the weekly broadcast. </p><p> Katrina's features relaxed slightly into an expression of sympathy. "I know we were going to bring you on the last two minutes of the show and talk about your theory. What was the title of your thesis again?" </p><p> "Compatibility as the Key to a Successful Marriage," she managed through clenched teeth. </p><p> "Right. But with Dr. Bill getting food poisoning last night and our show being live, we had to make some changes." Katrina patted her hand. "Think of the exposure. Maybe now you'll get a book contract." </p><p> "Maybe," Taylor murmured, thinking she would rather go home. Dreams of fame and fortune were way overrated, anyway. Right? </p><p> A man standing just outside the bright lights yelled something about ten seconds back to air. </p><p> Exposure for her theory, she reminded herself, repeating the phrase like a mantra. Exposure meant interest. Interest could mean a sale. A sale meant a lot of things -- like the potential of financial stability, validation, and a chance to feel she'd accomplished her goals. </p><p> She'd been doing her darnedest to sell her book on compatibility, but so far no one had made an offer. Part of the problem was her lack of expertise. She was a single mom from a small town no one had ever heard of. Her doctorate was so new that in human terms, it was still a zygote and her entire publishing history consisted of exactly two professional articles. Hardly a body of work impressive enough to inspire excitement in the publishing world. </p><p> <i>Or on cable television,</i> she thought, wondering how she was supposed to fill thirty minutes of live TV. </p><p> "Five, four, three -- " </p><p> Suddenly the lights got much brighter and Katrina turned her smooth face toward an invisible audience. </p><p> "We're back with Dr. Taylor McGuire, whose thesis, "Compatibility as the Key to a Successful Marriage" is stirring interest in the world of psychology. Tell us about your ideas, Dr. McGuire." </p><p> Taylor tried to remember the only yoga class she'd ever attended. She'd been unable to walk for nearly a week after because her body just plain didn't bend that way, but she did recall how wonderful the deep breathing had been. That's what she needed to do now. Keep breathing. </p><p> "I have a private practice," she said, hoping her voice wasn't shaking as badly as she feared. "Over the past few years the emphasis has been on marriage counseling and premarital seminars. I began to notice a pattern in successful relationships -- not just marriages. From my observations I realized that the more people had in common, the more easily they could get along." </p><p> Katrina nodded. "You realize that there are those who don't agree with you." </p><p> "Of course." Taylor thought about saying they were wrong. </p><p> "One such person is a frequent and popular guest here on <i>Psychology in the News.</i> Dr. Jonathan Kirby. Dr. Kirby, as we all know, believes that opposites attract and make for the most exciting marriages. In fact, he's written several books on the subject. He's here now and I'm hoping that he and Dr. McGuire can enter into a spirited discussion on the matter." </p><p> The room might have been blurring before, but now it was positively spinning. Jonathan Kirby here? Now? It wasn't possible. No trick of fate could be that unkind. </p><p> Oh, but it could, she realized a heartbeat later when a tall, dark-haired man strolled out onto the set. He had a lean, yet powerful body, and moved with the grace of someone comfortable in front of a television camera. Or naked. Jonathan had always been completely unselfconscious in the buff. It was just one of oh, fifty million factoids that zipped through her brain. They flew through in a nanosecond, accompanied by a screaming voice reminding her that seventeen years ago, Dr. Jonathan Kirby had dumped her and walked away without a backward glance. </p><p> <i>This is so unfair,</i> she thought. Reminding herself that life was not fair didn't make her feel any better. She wasn't even surprised. This was so her life. Just when she thought she had it all together, a ghost from her past showed up to rip it all apart....on live cable, no less. </p><p> "And we're out," the disembodied voice from beyond the cameras called. "Back in a minute-thirty, people. Stay ready." </p><p> The intensity of lights faded some. Katrina rushed from behind her desk toward Jonathan. </p><p> "Thank you so much for coming," she purred, placing one long, slender hand on his upper arm. "When I heard that Dr. Bill was sick and our only other guest was Taylor here, I nearly died." Katrina flashed Taylor a smile. "No offense, dear, but no one has heard of you, and your ideas aren't exactly earth-shattering enough to fill up the entire half hour." </p><p> Taylor wasn't offended. She felt like Humphrey Bogart in <i>Casablanca.</i> Of all the psychologists and all the talk shows in all the world, why did he have to show up at this one? </p><p> Jonathan didn't respond to Katrina, instead focusing all of his considerable attention on Taylor, making her feel as if she were the most beautiful creature on the planet. He'd always been good at that trick, she reminded herself, even as she fell for it. </p><p> "Congratulations," he said, speaking for the first time, "on receiving your doctorate and your publications." </p><p> That voice. That liquid chocolate, come-to-bed-with-me-and-I'll-make-you-touch-the-stars voice. Telling herself she was immune was one thing. Ignoring the sensation of bone-melting desire was another. </p><p> "Congratulations to you as well," she said, giving him her best smile and thanking God her bout with the flu the previous month had made her lose five pounds. "You always wanted to be the top in your field and you are. Dr. Jonathan Kirby, superstar." </p><p> "Thirty seconds, people." </p><p> Katrina raised an eyebrow. "You two know each other?" </p><p> "Of course," Taylor said, holding out her hand to the man who had once been the center of her universe. The sudden flood of sexual attraction was a tad distracting but she was determined to be a grown-up about the situation. </p><p> She realized then that facing a blast from her past was the best medicine for overcoming her fear of being on television. The trembling had fled. In its place was a sense of purpose. She could debate Jonathan Kirby</p></p><h2>Refusing Racism: White Allies and the Struggle for Civil Rights (The Teaching for Social Justice Series)</h2><p><p>Why and how have whites joined people of color to fight against white supremacy in the United States?

Religious Studies Review</p><h2>Niko&#39;s Nature: The Life of Niko Tinbergen and His Science of Animal Behaviour</h2><p>Here is the first biography of Niko Tinbergen, the brilliant but reticent naturalist (once described as "pathologically modest") who turned a passion for observing nature into a revolutionary new branch of science that illuminated the study of animal behavior. <br> Tracing the closely intertwined threads of Niko's personal and professional life, Hans Kruuk reveals the man behind the scientist. He shows how Niko's Calvinist upbringing in a highly intellectual Dutch family--his father was a much-published scholar, his elder brother a Nobel Laureate in Economics--the two-years he spent in a hostage camp during the Nazi occupation of Holland, and most importantly the magical year in Greenland, where he lived amongst the Inuit and observed animals in their natural habitat--an experience that would shape his scientific disposition. The period in Greenland set the stage for the groundbreaking experiments with free-living birds in the 1930s and 1940s that brought the study of animal behavior out of the laboratory and into the wild. Kruuk also offers an illuminating exploration of Niko's work with Konrad Lorenz, for which he won the Nobel Prize in 1973; his great success as a teacher at Oxford, where he was known by enthusiastic students--Desmond Morris, Richard Dawkins, and John Krebs, among them--as "The Maestro"; his frequent bouts of depression; the triumph of his book <em>The Study of Instinct</em>, which established ethology as a science; his controversial work on autism in children, and much more.<br> Written by Hans Kruuk, a former student of Niko Tinbergen and himself a distinguished scientist, <em>Niko's Nature</em> offers a fascinating and affectionate account of the man who forever changed the way we think about animal behavior.<br></p><p><br><strong>Hans Kruuk</strong> is Honorary Professor of Zoology at the University of Aberdeen.<br><br>"An impressive tribute to a brilliant scientist. Kruuk gives us a comprehensive, warts-and-all account of the life of one of the 20th century's most distinguished biologists and his contributions to the development of the field of animal behavior. In doing so, Kruuk also shows what science is really like.... His book demonstrates quite beautifully that scientific endeavor in all its imperfection can lead to great results."--<em>Science</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Darwin&#39;s Metaphor</h2><p>In this collection of closely interrelated essays, Robert Young emphasizes the scope of the nineteenth-century debate on &#39;man&#39;s place in nature&#39; at the same time as he engages with the approaches of scholars who write about it. He is critical of the separation of the writing of history from writing about history, historiography, and of the separation of history from politics and ideology, then or now. Dr Young challenges fellow historians for reimposing the very disciplinary boundaries that the nineteenth-century debate showed were in the service of ideological forces in that culture. Rather, he proposes that the full weight of the contending forces should be made apparent and debated openly so that neither nineteenth-century nor contemporary issues about the role of science in culture should be treated in a narrow perspective.</p><p></p><h2>The Race to Save the Lord God Bird</h2><p><p>The tragedy of extinction is explained through the dramatic story of a legendary bird, the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, and of those who tried to possess it, paint it, shoot it, sell it, and, in a last-ditch effort, save it. A powerful saga that sweeps through two hundred years of history, it introduces artists like John James Audubon, bird collectors like William Brewster, and finally a new breed of scientist in Cornell's Arthur A. "Doc" Allen and his young ornithology student, James Tanner, whose quest to save the Ivory-bill culminates in one of the first great conservation showdowns in U.S. history, an early round in what is now a worldwide effort to save species. As hope for the Ivory-bill fades in the United States, the bird is last spotted in Cuba in 1987, and Cuban scientists join in the race to save it.</p><p>All this, plus Mr. Hoose's wonderful story-telling skills, comes together to give us what David Allen Sibley, author of <i>The Sibley Guide to Birds</i> calls "the most thorough and readable account to date of the personalities, fashions, economics, and politics that combined to bring about the demise of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker."</p><p><i>The Race to Save the Lord God Bird</i> is the winner of the 2005 Boston Globe - Horn Book Award for Nonfiction and the 2005 Bank Street - Flora Stieglitz Award.</p><p>This new edition of the author's award-winning history features a new chapter about the endlessly debated 2004 Arkansas "rediscovery" of the ivory-billed woodpecker that made headlines around the world, as well as an expanded introduction and more than a dozen new images.</p></p><p>"A groundbreaking book for readers of any age. In a true story spanning two hundred years, Hoose delivers a spellbinding mystery and a haunting look at how a species can suddenly lose ground...Above all, this is a story about attitudes - toward birds, toward knowledge, toward land and science and wealth, and about the magical commonality of living things."<br>-- Paul R. Ehrlich, author of "The Population Bomb" and President, Center for Conservation Biology, Stanford University <br>"Phil Hoose uses his wonderful storytelling skills to give us the most thorough and readable account to date of the personalities, fashions, economics, and politics that combined to bring about the demise of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker. I found myself thinking about "The Race to Save the Lord God Bird" long after I finished reading it."<br>-- David Allen Sibley, author of "The Sibley Guide to Birds" <br>"If all Phil Hoose did in "The Race to Save the Lord God Bird "was tell the story of the Ivory-billed Woodpecker, that would be enough, because he spins a mesmerizing tale - full of vivid characters and wilderness landscapes so real you can almost feel the humidity and hear the bellowing alligators. But his underlying message takes readers beyond the battle to save one glorious bird, and shows why some people dedicate their lives and hearts to fighting extinction - a hopeful message that is more important now than ever." <br>-- Scott Weidensaul, author of "The Ghost with Trembling Wings" <br>"What a wonderful book! How we got into a biodiversity crisis and how we might begin to get out of it, all captured in the suspenseful, many-threaded tale of the race to save the Ivory-billed Woodpecker.

How do you dance about death? How do you draw a diagram explaining entropy? Images and Understanding explores the human problem of moving facts and ideas from one mind to another - the problems of how we see and communicate using images expressed in pictures, diagrams, words, music and dance. For artists as well as scientists discussion of this topic is timely; electronic and computing technology is expanding the means of generating and communicating images, while physiology and psychology are revealing the neural mechanisms of coding, perceiving and understanding them. The book is divided into six sections, each with an explanatory introduction followed by comprehensively illustrated contributions from internationally distinguished figures from fields as diverse as art history, choreography, psychology, computer science, and philosophy. Images and Understanding is unique in viewing the problems of imagery through the eyes of both science and art; it gives new insight into images and new ideas about understanding.</p><p>.&#34;..a useful survey of visual art.&#39;&#34; Choice</p><h2>A History of Inner Asia</h2><p>This accessible introduction to Inner Asia traces its history from the arrival of Islam, through the various dynasties to the Russian conquest.

I don&#39;t mean the very young. No. The very young have, properly speaking, no moments. It is the privilege of early youth to live in advance of its days in all the beautiful continuity of hope which knows no pauses and no introspection.One closes behind one the little gate of mere boyishness--and enters an enchanted garden. Its very shades glow with promise. Every turn of the path has its seduction. And it isn&#39;t because it is an undiscovered country. One knows well enough that all mankind had streamed that way. It is the charm of universal experience from which one expects an uncommon or personal sensation--a bit of one&#39;s own.One goes on recognising the landmarks of the predecessors, excited, amused, taking the hard luck and the good luck together--the kicks and the halfpence, as the saying is--the picturesque common lot that holds so many possibilities for the deserving or perhaps for the lucky. Yes. One goes on. And the time, too, goes on--till one perceives ahead a shadow-line warning one that the region of early youth, too, must be left behind.This is the period of life in which such moments of which I have spoken are likely to come. What moments? Why, the moments of boredom, of weariness, of dissatisfaction. Rash moments. I mean moments when the still young are inclined to commit rash actions, such as getting married suddenly or else throwing up a job for no reason.This is not a marriage story. It wasn&#39;t so bad as that with me. My action, rash as it was, had more the character of divorce--almost of desertion. For no reason on which a sensible person could put a finger I threw up my job--chucked my berth--left the ship of which the worst that could be said was that she was a steamship and therefore, perhaps, not entitled to that blind loyalty which . . . However, it&#39;s no use trying to put a gloss on what even at the time I myself half suspected to be a caprice.It was in an Eastern port. She was an Eastern ship, inasmuch as then she belonged to that port. She traded among dark islands on a blue reef-scarred sea, with the Red Ensign over the taffrail and at her masthead a house-flag, also red, but with a green border and with a white crescent in it. For an Arab owned her, and a Syed at that. Hence the green border on the flag. He was the head of a great House of Straits Arabs, but as loyal a subject of the complex British Empire as you could find east of the Suez Canal. World politics did not trouble him at all, but he had a great occult power amongst his own people.It was all one to us who owned the ship. He had to employ white men in the shipping part of his business, and many of those he so employed had never set eyes on him from the first to the last day. I myself saw him but once, quite accidentally on a wharf--an old, dark little man blind in one eye, in a snowy robe and yellow slippers. He was having his hand severely kissed by a crowd of Malay pilgrims to whom he had done some favour, in the way of food and money. His alms-giving, I have heard, was most extensive, covering almost the whole Archipelago. For isn&#39;t it said that &#34;The charitable man is the friend of Allah&#34;?Excellent (and picturesque) Arab owner, about whom one needed not to trouble one&#39;s head, a most excellent Scottish ship--for she was that from the keel up--excellent sea-boat, easy to keep clean, most handy in every way, and if it had not been for her internal propulsion, worthy of any man&#39;s love; I cherish to this day a profound respect for her memory. As to the kind of trade she was engaged in and the character of my shipmates, I could not have been happier if I had had the life and the men made to my order by a benevolent Enchanter.And suddenly I left all this. I left it in that, to us, inconsequential manner in which a bird flies away from a comfortable branch. It was as though all unknowing I had heard a whisper or seen something. Well--perhaps! One day I was perfectly right and the next everything was gone--glamour, flavour, interest, contentment--everything. It was one of these moments, you know. The green sickness of late youth descended on me and carried me off. Carried me off that ship, I mean.We were only four white men on board, with a large crew of Kalashes and two Malay petty officers. The Captain stared hard as if wondering what ailed me. But he was a sailor, and he, too, had been young at one time. Presently a smile came to lurk under his thick iron-grey moustache, and he observed that, of course, if I felt I must go he couldn&#39;t keep me by main force. And it was arranged that I should be paid off the next morning. As I was going out of the chart-room he added suddenly, in a peculiar wistful tone, that he hoped I would find what I was so anxious to go and look for. A soft, cryptic utterance which seemed to reach deeper than any diamond-hard tool could have done. I do believe he understood my case.But the second engineer attacked me differently. He was a sturdy young Scot, with a smooth face and light eyes. His honest red countenance emerged out of the engine-room companion and then the whole robust man, with shirt sleeves turned up, wiping slowly the massive fore-arms with a lump of cotton-waste. And his light eyes expressed bitter distaste, as though our friendship had turned to ashes. He said weightily: &#34;Oh! Aye! I&#39;ve been thinking it was about time for you to run away home and get married to some silly girl.&#34;It was tacitly understood in the port that John Nieven was a fierce mysogynist; and the absurd character of the sally convinced me that he meant to be nasty--very nasty--had meant to say the most crushing thing he could think of. My laugh sounded deprecatory. Nobody but a friend could be so angry as that. I became a little crestfallen. Our chief engineer also took a characteristic view of my action, but in a kindlier spirit.He was young, too, but very thin, and with a mist of fluffy brown beard all round his haggard face. All day long, at sea or in harbour, he could be seen walking hastily up and down the after-deck, wearing an intense, spiritually rapt expression, which was caused by a perpetual consciousness of unpleasant physical sensations in his internal economy. For he was a confirmed dyspeptic. His view of my case was very simple. He said it was nothing but deranged liver. Of course! He suggested I should stay for another trip and meantime dose myself with a certain patent medicine in which his own belief was absolute. &#34;I&#39;ll tell you what I&#39;ll do. I&#39;ll buy you two bottles, out of my own pocket. There. I can&#39;t say fairer than that, can I?&#34;I believe he would have perpetrated the atrocity (or generosity) at the merest sign of weakening on my part. By that time, however, I was more discontented, disgusted, and dogged than ever. The past eighteen months, so full of new and varied experience, appeared a dreary, prosaic waste of days. I felt--how shall I express it?--that there was no truth to be got out of them.What truth? I should have been hard put to it to explain. Probably, if pressed, I would have burst into tears simply. I was young enough for that.Next day the Captain and I transacted our business in the Harbour Office. It was a lofty, big, cool, white room, where the screened light of day glowed serenely. Everybody in it--the officials, the public--were in white. Only the heavy polished desks gleamed darkly in a central avenue, and some papers lying on them were blue. Enormous punkahs sent from on high a gentle draught through that immaculate interior and upon our perspiring heads.The official behind the desk we approached grinned amiably and kept it up till, in answer to his perfunctory question, &#34;Sign off and on again?&#34; my Captain answered, &#34;No! Signing off for good.&#34; And then his grin vanished in sudden solemnity. He did not look at me again till he handed me my papers with a sorrowful expression, as if they had been my passports for Hades.While I was putting them away he murmured some question to the Captain, and I heard the latter answer good-humouredly:&#34;No. He leaves us to go home.&#34;&#34;Oh!&#34; the other exclaimed, nodding mournfully over my sad condition.I didn&#39;t know him outside the official building, but he leaned forward over the desk to shake hands with me, compassionately, as one would with some poor devil going out to be hanged; and I am afraid I performed my part ungraciously, in the hardened manner of an impenitent criminal.No homeward-bound mail-boat was due for three or four days. Being now a man without a ship, and having for a time broken my connection with the sea--become, in fact, a mere potential passenger--it would have been more appropriate perhaps if I had gone to stay at a hotel. There it was, too, within a stone&#39;s throw of the Harbour Office, low, but somehow palatial, displaying its white, pillared pavilions surrounded by trim grass plots. I would have felt a passenger indeed in there! I gave it a hostile glance and directed my steps towards the Officers&#39; Sailors&#39; Home.I walked in the sunshine, disregarding it, and in the shade of the big trees on the esplanade without enjoying it. The heat of the tropical East descended through the leafy boughs, enveloping my thinly-clad body, clinging to my rebellious discontent, as if to rob it of its freedom.The Officers&#39; Home was a large bungalow with a wide verandah and a curiously suburban-looking little garden of bushes and a few trees between it and the street. That institution partook somewhat of the character of a residential club, but with a slightly Governmental flavour about it, because it was administered by the Harbour Office. Its manager was officially styled Chief Steward. He was an unhappy, wizened little man, who if put into a jockey&#39;s rig would have looked the part to perfection. But it was obvious that at some time or other in his life, in some capacity or other, he had been connected with the sea. Possibly in the comprehensive capacity of a failure.I should have thought his employment a very easy one, but he used to affirm for some reason or other that his job would be the death of him some day. It was rather mysterious. Perhaps everything naturally was too much trouble for him. He certainly seemed to hate having people in the house.On entering it I thought he must be feeling pleased. It was as still as a tomb. I could see no one in the living rooms; and the verandah, too, was empty, except for a man at the far end dozing prone in a long chair. At the noise of my footsteps he opened one horribly fish-like eye. He was a stranger to me. I retreated from there, and, crossing the dining-room--a very bare apartment with a motionless punkah hanging over the centre table--I knocked at a door labelled in black letters: &#34;Chief Steward.&#34;The answer to my knock being a vexed and doleful plaint: &#34;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! What is it now?&#34; I went in at once.It was a strange room to find in the tropics. Twilight and stuffiness reigned in there. The fellow had hung enormously ample, dusty, cheap lace curtains over his windows, which were shut. Piles of cardboard boxes, such as milliners and dressmakers use in Europe, cumbered the corners; and by some means he had procured for himself the sort of furniture that might have come out of a respectable parlour in the East End of London--a horsehair sofa, arm-chairs of the same. I glimpsed grimy antimacassars scattered over that horrid upholstery, which was awe-inspiring, insomuch that one could not guess what mysterious accident, need, or fancy had collected it there. Its owner had taken off his tunic, and in white trousers and a thin short-sleeved singlet prowled behind the chair-backs nursing his meagre elbows.An exclamation of dismay escaped him when he heard that I had come for a stay; but he could not deny that there were plenty of vacant rooms.&#34;Very well. Can you give me the one I had before?&#34;He emitted a faint moan from behind a pile of cardboard boxes on the table, which might have contained gloves or handkerchiefs or neckties. I wonder what the fellow did keep in them? There was a smell of decaying coral, of oriental dust, of zoological specimens in that den of his. I could only see the top of his head and his unhappy eyes levelled at me over the barrier.&#34;It&#39;s only for a couple of days,&#34; I said, intending to cheer him up.&#34;Perhaps you would like to pay in advance?&#34; he suggested eagerly.&#34;Certainly not!&#34; I burst out directly I could speak. &#34;Never heard of such a thing! This is the most infernal cheek. . . .&#34;He had seized his head in both hands--a gesture of despair which checked my indignation.&#34;Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don&#39;t fly out like this. I am asking everybody.&#34;&#34;I don&#39;t believe it,&#34; I said bluntly.&#34;Well, I am going to. And if you gentlemen all agreed to pay in advance I could make Hamilton pay up too. He&#39;s always turning up ashore dead broke, and even when he has some money he won&#39;t settle his bills. I don&#39;t know what to do with him. He swears at me and tells me I can&#39;t chuck a white man out into the street here. So if you only would. . . .&#34;I was amazed. Incredulous too. I suspected the fellow of gratuitous impertinence. I told him with marked emphasis that I would see him and Hamilton hanged first, and requested him to conduct me to my room with no more of his nonsense. He produced then a key from somewhere and led the way out of his lair, giving me a vicious sidelong look in passing.&#34;Any one I know staying here?&#34; I asked him before he left my room.He had recovered his usual pained impatient tone, and said that Captain Giles was there, back from a Solo Sea trip. Two other guests were staying also. He paused. And, of course, Hamilton, he added.&#34;Oh, yes! Hamilton,&#34; I said, and the miserable creature took himself off with a final groan.</p><h2>Milady&#39;s Standard Cosmetology</h2><p>Since 1938, the Milady Standard Cosmetology has been the premier textbook for Cosmetology education.

The case studies include assessments of initiatives such as community organizing, fair trade, and the Sanctuary movement. <p>Bretherton integrates debates in political theology with analysis of policy and practice regarding religious social, political, and economic engagement in the USA, UK, and continental Europe, but avoids presenting an idealized archetype for church&#x2013;state relations. Instead, he engages with the intricacies of contemporary politics while integrating systematic and historical theological reflection on political and economic life. The book delineates the ways in which &#x201c;faithful witness&#x201d; and the forging of a common good &#x2013; at local, national, and global levels &#x2013; emerge through a dynamic of listening, judgment, and proclamation between Christians and those of other faiths and of no faith. Rather than advocate withdrawal or assimilation, the book reveals how faithful witness can help prevent the subversion of the church &#x2013; and even of politics itself &#x2013; by legal, bureaucratic, and market mechanisms.</p> <p>Relations between religious and political spheres continue to stir passionate debates on both sides of the Atlantic.

It helps them fully integrate the details of all the disorders and distinguish between the more important concepts. The Big Picture feature emphasizes the important comparisons and contrasts to other concepts presented in the chapters. A new discussion on mental disorders shows how the interpretation of behaviors is dependent on the context in which those behaviors occur. The eleventh edition also demonstrates how context drives the definitions of normal and abnormal behavior. With the new features, psychologists will find the material to be more accessible, engaging, and informative.</p><p></p><h2>UNDER ATTACK/THE CASE AGAINST BILINGUAL EDUCATION</h2><p>Stephen Krashen takes on the critics of bilingual education, providing compelling answers to some persistent questions.</p><p>Stephen Krashen completed his Ph.D. in Linguistics at UCLA (1972), and is currently a Professor of Education at the University of Southern California.

Historians have long assumed that ideological views and the momentum of events made American intervention inevitable. By examining the role of McGeorge Bundy and the National Security Council, Andrew Preston demonstrates that policymakers escalated the conflict in Vietnam in the face of internal opposition, external pressures, and a continually failing strategy. </p><p> Bundy created the position of National Security Adviser as we know it today, with momentous consequences that continue to shape American foreign policy. Both today's presidential supremacy in foreign policy and the contemporary national security bureaucracy find their origins in Bundy's powers as the first National Security Adviser and in the ways in which he and his staff brought about American intervention in Vietnam. Presidents Kennedy and Johnson were not enthusiastic about waging a difficult war in pursuit of murky aims, but the NSC's bureaucratic dexterity and persuasive influence in the Oval Office skewed the debate in favor of the conflict. </p><p> In challenging the prevailing view of Bundy as a loyal but quietly doubting warrior, Preston also revises our understanding of what it meant--and means--to be a hawk or a dove. <i>The War Council</i> is an illuminating and compelling story with two inseparable themes: the acquisition and consolidation of power; and how that power is exercised. </p></p><p>Andrew Preston is University Lecturer in History and a Fellow of Clare College, Cambridge University.A superb study of one of the key shapers of America's Vietnam policy and of the National Security Council he led. Preston is an enormously talented young historian, and his skills are on display in this powerful and instructive book. <br> --Fredrik Logevall, author of <i>Choosing War: The Lost Chance for Peace and the Escalation of War in Vietnam</i><br><br>An impressive book that establishes more than any previous work the critical role of the reorganized National Security Council under Kennedy and Johnson. Preston skillfully demonstrates that McGeorge Bundy was key in gaining the national security adviser an influence comparable to that of the secretaries of state and defense. <br> --Gary R. Hess, author of <i>Presidential Decisions for War</i><br><br>In a vivid portrait of the intelligent, influential, and insidious McGeorge Bundy, Preston demonstrates that Bundy and his counterparts failed as policymakers because they made choices that reflected their own experiences, not the conditions of the world beyond America's borders. This is a sobering and timely book that everyone interested in foreign policy should read.<br> --Jeremi Suri, author of <i>Power and Protest: Global Revolution and the Rise of Detente</i><br><br>A powerful and graceful account of the influence of McGeorge Bundy's National Security Council in shaping U.S. foreign policy in the Vietnam era. Preston's astute examination of the 'soft hawks' who took us to war underscores the need for us to constantly revise what we know of our history. <i>The War Council</i> is a formidable contribution.<br> --Kai Bird, co-author of <i>American Prometheus: The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer</i><br><br>It is in exploring how Bundy convinced two presidents of the rightness of his argument that <i>The War Council</i> provides fresh insight. Most histories of the Vietnam war focus either on the combat itself or on the political leadership involved. Mr. Preston looks not at the flashes of gunfire but at the more shadowy world of bureaucratic infighting...[<i>The War Council</i>] shows all too clearly what happens when the White House circle of decision-makers has too small a radius. Clearly, leaders have the right to rely on a loyal few; excessive debate and deadlock are not desirable. But as America is once again learning, people in power need to make sure that the decisive circle includes those who actually know a region.

What makes for a good life? <br><br>In <em>The Best Things in Life</em>, distinguished philosopher Thomas Hurka takes a fresh look at these perennial questions as they arise for us now in the 21st century. Should we value family over career? How do we balance self-interest and serving others? What activities bring us the most joy? While religion, literature, popular psychology, and everyday wisdom all grapple with these questions, philosophy more than anything else uses the tools of reason to make important distinctions, cut away irrelevancies, and distill these issues down to their essentials. Hurka argues that if we are to live a good life, one thing we need to know is which activities and experiences will most likely lead us to happiness and which will keep us from it, while also reminding us that happiness isn't the only thing that makes life good. Hurka explores many topics: four types of good feeling (and the limits of good feeling); how we can improve our baseline level of happiness (making more money, it turns out, isn't the answer); which kinds of knowledge are most worth having; the importance of achieving worthwhile goals; the value of love and friendship; and much more. Unlike many philosophers, he stresses that there isn't just one good in life but many: pleasure, as Epicurus argued, is indeed one, but knowledge, as Socrates contended, is another, as is achievement. And while the great philosophers can help us understand what matters most in life, Hurka shows that we must ultimately decide for ourselves. <br> This delightfully accessible book offers timely guidance on answering the most important question any of us will ever ask: How do we live a good life?<br></p><p><br><strong>Thomas Hurka</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Toronto and the author of <em>Virtue, Vice, and Value</em>; <em>Principles: Short Essays on Ethics</em>; and <em>Perfectionism</em>.<br><br>"The book is filled with common sense and practical wisdom. As a practical 'guide to what really matters' for general readers and philosophers alike, it is a worthy modern representative of a tradition of ethical writing that goes back to Aristotle's own guide to what really matters, written for his son Nicoachus. From my point of view, that is high praise indeed."--Robert Kane, <em>Ethics</em><p></p><br>"A stimulating read and a great way to get you focused on the right things at the beginning of the year."--Fareed Zakaria, CNN<p></p><br>"Thomas Hurka's <em>The Best Things in Life</em> is that rare thing: a philosophical work written with such simplicity and verve that it will engage beginning students, but with enough subtlety and sophistication that it will also reward careful study by specialists. An important contribution to ethics."--<em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Most of us know the main sorts of things that can make a life worth living: happiness and pleasure, friendship and love, accomplishment, knowledge, and virtue. But few of us could probably say very much about just what these things really are, and what, exactly, makes them so valuable. That's where Tom Hurka comes in. <em>The Best Things in Life</em> provides an original and fascinating philosophical guide to some of life's most important questions. For the most part, of course, it's not exactly a practical guide-it won't tell you how to find love, or how to be virtuous or successful. But it will give you a far better sense of what you should be looking for, and why."--Shelly Kagan, Yale University<p></p><br>"this book makes you work, be self-reflective, and actually do philosophy. It helps you hone these important life skills. Thomas Hurka presents dense philosophical themes with clear diction and offers interesting examples that are not bogged down with technical jargon or require specialized knowledge. Overall, this text is a welcomed addition to the scholarship and practice of teaching contemplation-in-action, and I recommend it with enthusiasm." --<em>Philosophical Practice</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>How to Write Anything with Readings: A Guide and Reference</h2><p><p>Instructors at hundreds of colleges and universities have turned to<i> How to Write Anything</i> for support that empowers every student with advice they need, when they need it. &nbsp;And students love it&#x2015;holding onto the book for other classes &#x2015;because the authors&#x2019; tone makes writing in any genre approachable, with a flexible, rhetorical framework for the most commonly taught academic and public genres.<br><br>The fourth edition offers students a new Part 1: Strategies for College Writing, even more support for understanding genres and purpose, and an expanded and thoroughly revised take on grammar, mechanics, and usage&#x2015;all essential to academic success.

A mysterious shape-changing Confidence-Man approaches passengers on a Mississippi steamboat and, winning over the (not quite innocent) victims with his charm, urges them to implicitly trust in the cosmos, in nature, and even in human nature-with predictable results.<br><br><i>The Confidence-Man</i> represented a departure for Melville, a satirical and socially acute work that was to be a further step away from his sea novels. Yet it confused and angered reviewers who preferred to pigeonhole him as an adventure writer. Some have argued the book was a joke on the readers loyal to his sea stories, but if so, it backfired. Dismissed by critics as unreadable, and an undoubted financial failure, <i>The Confidence-Man</i>'s cold reception undermined Melville's belief in his ability to make a living writing works that were both popular and profound, and he soon gave up fiction. It was not until the mid-twentieth century that critics rediscovered the book and praised its wit, stunningly modern technique, and wry view that life may be just a cosmic con game.&#34;In &#34;The Confidence-Man,&#34; writes John Bryant in his Introduction, &#34;Melville found a way to render our tragic sense of self and society through the comic strategies of the confidence game. He puts the reader in the game to play its parts and to contemplate the inconsistencies of its knaves and fools.&#34; Set on a Mississippi steamer on April Fool&#39;s Day and populated by a series of shape-shifting con men, &#34;The Confidence-Man is a challenging metaphysical and ethical exploration of antebellum American society. Set from the first American edition of 1857, this Modern Library paperback includes an Appendix with Bryant&#39;s innovative &#34;fluid text&#34; analysis of early manuscript fragments from Melville&#39;s novel.</p><h2>Study Guide/Lab Manual to accompany Refrigeration and Air Conditioning Technology, 6th Edition</h2><p>The Lab Manual for REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING TECHNOLOGY, 6th Edition, is a valuable tool designed to enhance your classroom experience.

Now the crew of the Pequod, on a pursuit that features constant adventure and horrendous mishaps, must follow the mad Ahab into the abyss to satisfy his unslakeable thirst for vengeance. Narrated by the cunningly observant crew member Ishmael, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is the tale of the hunt for the elusive, omnipotent, and ultimately mystifying white whale&#x2014;Moby Dick.<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>On its surface, <i>Moby-Dick</i> is a vivid documentary of life aboard a nineteenth-century whaler, a virtual encyclopedia of whales and whaling, replete with facts, legends, and trivia that <b>Melville</b> had gleaned from personal experience and scores of sources. But as the quest for the whale becomes increasingly perilous, the tale works on allegorical levels, likening the whale to human greed, moral consequence, good, evil, and life itself. Who is good? The great white whale who, like Nature, asks nothing but to be left in peace? Or the bold Ahab who, like scientists, explorers, and philosophers, fearlessly probes the mysteries of the universe? Who is evil? The ferocious, man-killing sea monster? Or the revenge-obsessed madman who ignores his own better nature in his quest to kill the beast? <br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Scorned by critics upon its publication, <i>Moby-Dick</i> was publicly derided during its author&#x2019;s lifetime.

That insult, delivered by a lawyer at a dinner party, set Mali to writing a poem in answer to the question&#x2014;What do you make?&#x2014;that sparked the insult. His poem, which went viral, addressed the question not from the perspective of monetary earnings but from the perspective of what teachers actually make or contribute to the lives of students. Teachers make students wonder, think, create&#x2014;all the great things we hope for children. Mali left teaching to explore his love of poetry but kept at the theme of what teachers make, eventually taking on a commitment to inspire 1,000 people to become teachers. This book is in part an inspiring anthem for teaching and in part a practical guide to effective teaching techniques. Mali ends with a plea for better teacher training, incentives for teachers to teach in underperforming schools, and a heartfelt plea never to give up on struggling students, whatever their backgrounds.

Through our clicks and swipes, logins and profiles, emails and posts, we are, more or less willingly, participating in digital activities that yield economic value to others but little or no return to us. Hamid Ekbia and Bonnie Nardi call this kind of participation&#x2015;the extraction of economic value from low-cost or free labor in computer-mediated networks&#x2015;&#x201c;heteromation.&#x201d; In this book, they explore the social and technological processes through which economic value is extracted from digitally mediated work, the nature of the value created, and what prompts people to participate in the process.</p><p>Arguing that heteromation is a new logic of capital accumulation, Ekbia and Nardi consider different kinds of heteromated labor: communicative labor, seen in user-generated content on social media; cognitive labor, including microwork and self-service; creative labor, from gaming environments to literary productions; emotional labor, often hidden within paid jobs; and organizing labor, made up of collaborative groups such as citizen scientists.

Despite abundant resources&#x2014;and a history of productivity and wealth&#x2014;in recent decades the region has fallen further and further behind developed nations, surpassed even by other developing economies in Southeast Asia and elsewhere.<br><br>In <i>Left Behind</i>, Sebastian Edwards explains why the nations of Latin America have failed to share in the fruits of globalization and forcefully highlights the dangers of the recent turn to economic populism in the region. He begins by detailing the many ways Latin American governments have stifled economic development over the years through excessive regulation, currency manipulation, and thoroughgoing corruption. He then turns to the neoliberal reforms of the early 1990s, which called for the elimination of deficits, lowering of trade barriers, and privatization of inefficient public enterprises&#x2014;and which, Edwards argues, held the promise of freeing Latin America from the burdens of the past. Flawed implementation, however, meant the promised gains of globalization were never felt by the mass of citizens, and growing frustration with stalled progress has led to a resurgence of populism throughout the region, exemplified by the economic policies of Venezuela&#x2019;s<i></i>Hugo Ch�vez. But such measures, Edwards warns, are a recipe for disaster; instead, he argues, the way forward for Latin America lies in further market reforms, more honestly pursued and fairly implemented. As an example of the promise of that approach, Edwards points to Latin America's giant, Brazil, which under the successful administration of President Luis In�cio da Silva (Lula) has finally begun to show signs of reaching its true economic potential.<br><br>As the global financial crisis has reminded us, the risks posed by failing economies extend far beyond their national borders. Putting Latin America back on a path toward sustained growth is crucial not just for the region but for the world, and <i>Left Behind</i> offers a clear, concise blueprint for the way forward.<br></p></p><p><b>Sebastian Edwards</b> is the Henry Ford II Professor of International Economics in the Anderson Graduate School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.<p>"A masterly analysis that explains why economic populism in Latin America has been unable to reduce poverty&#x2014;and never will.

This book explores questions such as when is it permissible to alter a person&#39;s memories, influence personality traits or read minds? What can neuroscience tell us about free will, self-control, self-deception and the foundations of morality? The view of neuroethics offered here argues that many of our new powers to read ,alter and control minds are not entirely unparalleled with older ones. They have, however, expanded to include almost all our social, political and ethical decisions. Written primarily for graduate students, this book will appeal to anyone with an interest in the more philosophical and ethical aspects of the neurosciences.</p><p>Devoting equal attention to the ethical issues and to philosophical reflection, this book summarises our questions and understanding of free-will, self-control, self-deception and the foundations of morality.

Duchamp was a willing partner in the book&#x2019;s creation. In fact, his active participation in both its conception and layout was so substantial that the book is considered part of the artist&#x2019;s oeuvre. But the project took six years to complete. The trials, tribulations, quarrels, and machinations that plagued the production, publication, and publicity of <i>Sur Marcel Duchamp</i> are the focus of this correspondence between two lifelong friends.<br> &nbsp;<br> Translated and printed in full together for the first time, and including the original French texts, these letters, postcards, and telegrams from the collection of the Getty Research Institute offer uncensored access to the evolution of the relationship between Lebel and Duchamp from December 1946 to April 1967. They provide valuable information about their daily activities as well as those of friends and colleagues, vital details concerning their various collective projects, and illuminating insights into their thinking about art and life.

Luckily, Ellen M. Plante reveals how to tastefully transform any room into an elegant and comfortable living space--frills are not compulsory! <i>The Victorian Home</i> is not only a beautifully written design guide to reviving rooms from this era, it's also a fascinating history lesson on the culture of the mid- to late-19th-century gentrified society in Britain. For this privileged class, the home was the "center of the universe, a safe haven from a rapidly industrializing society." Therefore, every chair, ornament, and light fixture was carefully chosen and exquisitely arranged to create a look of maximum opulence. Today, the reasons to "go Victorian" are much simpler. This look can be a lovely addition to any home--a look that is both timeless and elegant. The rooms photographed in <i>The Victorian Home</i> reflect the wonderful versatility of this era. Some rooms merely capture the essence of the period in the style of the fireplace or the choice of wallpaper. Other rooms duplicate the era in every minute detail, right down to the arrangement of dishes and cutlery on a dinner table. Throughout this elegant book are useful sidebars providing tips and techniques for Victorian decorating, and a comprehensive index of expressions and terms.

The poem first appeared in 1872 in Lewis Carroll&#x2019;s classic THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE, and since then, its mysterious and lyrical lines have delighted readers of all ages. With great wit and imagination, illustrator Joel Stewart offers a singular vision of the world of "Jabberwocky" and all its memorable creatures.</p><p>Lewis Carroll was the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832-1898), who taught mathematics at Christ Church College, Oxford. He is the author of two classic stories of children&#x2019;s literature: ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND and THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS AND WHAT ALICE FOUND THERE. These books contain many of his most popular poems, including "Jabber-wocky," "The Walrus and the Carpenter," and "You are old, father William."<br>Joel Stewart studied at Falmouth College of Art, graduating with a degree in illustration. He is also the illustrator of THE ADVENTURES OF A NOSE by Viviane Schwarz. He says, "Carroll&#x2019;s language is so rich that it&#x2019;s a joy to depict just a few of the curious ideas it conjures up. As Alice herself says after reading it, &#x2018;Somehow it fills my head with ideas - only I don&#x2019;t know exactly what they are.&#x2019; "PreSchool-Grade 4-Carroll's classic nonsense poem gets a fresh visual interpretation here. In a series of spreads, a child mounts his quest for the fearsome Jabberwock in an "other" world in keeping with the delicious unknown conjured up on first hearing, "'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves-." After a glimpse of the hero, the real world shows up in the form of facing oval frames-one containing the poem, the other a Victorian father-and-son read-aloud scene. But from then on, with a few lines of the poem per page, children enter a spare landscape of rattan-printed trees, postage-stamp-sized art, and full-color ink-and-watercolor creatures whose simple, almost cartoonish look echoes Edward Lear's comic sketches. The uncluttered composition of these pages leaves plenty of room for Carroll's words to do their work. Printed in uppercase, in a faintly rune-ish serif typeface, they gyre and gimble, whiffle and burble cleanly across the page. Stewart has not paid precise attention to Humpty Dumpty's explication of the poem as it originally appears in Through the Looking-Glass, but he has captured that wordmeister's affinity for conglomeration and arbitrary meaning, creating his own odd creatures to inhabit Carroll's perfect peculiarities. The slightly removed tone is maintained by a climactic twist: when the vorpal blade snicker-snacks "through and through," the beast's innards are revealed to be mechanical-clockwork springs and gears. Other illustrated editions worth considering-Graeme Base's (Abrams, 1989) signature packed pages or Jane Breskin Zalben's (Warne, 1977; o.p.) delicately detailed watercolors-hew more closely to Humpty Dumpty's definitions, but this new version is a good choice for a younger audience, nicely conveying the lighthearted mysteriousness of the poem.<br><i>Nancy Palmer, The Little School, Bellevue, WA</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>25 Home Automation Projects for the Evil Genius</h2><p><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>TURN YOUR HOME SWEET HOME INTO AN AUTOMATED, EVIL GENIUS PARADISE!</b></p><p>Your home may be your castle-but can it cook your dinner?

Traditionally classified according to their shape, scientists now use DNA studies to refine the groupings of bacteria. This book examines bacteria that are found in virtually every environmentincluding those that are characterized by extreme heat, cold, and depthand, of course, bacteria that are found inside our bodies. Intriguing information highlights the key role that bacteria play in shaping the ecology of our planet, how some bacteria make their own food while others feed on ready-made food, and how some do indeed cause disease, while most do not. Case studies examine the development of new vaccines against bacterial diseases and the use of bacteria to help fight pollution.</p><p></p><h2>5 Steps to a 5: AP English Literature 2019</h2><p><b>A PERFECT PLAN FOR THE PERFECT SCORE&nbsp;</b><b><br></b><b>Score-Raising Features Include:</b><b><br></b>�6 full-length practice exams, 3 in the book + 3 on Cross-Platform�Hundreds of practice exercises with thorough answer explanations�Comprehensive overview of the AP English Language exam format&nbsp;�Proven strategies specific to each section of the exam�Strategies for deconstructing essay prompts and planning your essay�A comprehensive review of analysis and argument, and practice activities to hone your skills in close reading, critical thinking, and critical/ analytical/ argumentative writing<br><b>BONUS Cross-Platform Prep Course</b> for extra practice exams with personalized study plans, interactive tests, powerful analytics and progress charts, flashcards, games, and more!

Philip Ball describes how scientists are currently inventing thousands of new materials, ranging from synthetic skin, blood, and bone to substances that repair themselves and adapt to their environment, that swell and flex like muscles, that repel any ink or paint, and that capture and store the energy of the Sun. He shows how all this is being accomplished precisely because, for the first time in history, materials are being "made to measure": designed for particular applications, rather than discovered in nature or by haphazard experimentation. Now scientists literally put new materials together on the drawing board in the same way that a blueprint is specified for a house or an electronic circuit. But the designers are working not with skylights and alcoves, not with transistors and capacitors, but with molecules and atoms.</p><br><p> This book is written in the same engaging manner as Ball's popular book on chemistry, <i>Designing the Molecular World</i>, and it links insights from chemistry, biology, and physics with those from engineering as it outlines the various areas in which new materials will transform our lives in the twenty-first century. The chapters provide vignettes from a broad range of selected areas of materials science and can be read as separate essays. The subjects include photonic materials, materials for information storage, smart materials, biomaterials, biomedical materials, materials for clean energy, porous materials, diamond and hard materials, new polymers, and surfaces and interfaces.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Made to Measure</i> is a lucid account of the most advanced new materials. While it describes today's technology, this book is really about the future. If you like the down-to-the-last-atom designer 'stuff' described within, you'll love the twenty-first century. The future will be built of such stuff."--<b>Richard E. Smalley, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry</b></p><p>"The Materials Era anticipated the principal frontiers in science, technology, and engineering of the second half of the twentieth century. Philip Ball, in <i>Made to Measure</i>, extends these frontiers into the next millennium with skillful foresight. For Ball, the 'measure' of matter implies product design, wherein knowledge of rapidly advancing materials systems is now crucial for progress in commerce and culture. His book qualifies as a reference on the very matter that supports the Information Age."--<b>W. O. Baker, Retired Chairman of the Board, Bell Laboratories, Lucent Technologies</b></p><p>"Philip Ball's <i>Made to Measure</i> is an exceptional survey of state-of-art materials, science, and technology. It is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand where the advances in molecular physics are taking us in the 21st Century."--<b>Professor Sir Harry Kroto, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry</b></p><p>"The awesome cornucopia of modern material science, brimming with deft inventions and molecular marvels, is aptly and ably displayed here. Philip Ball's lucid exposition, augmented by dozens of well-crafted diagrams, celebrates the work of versatile bacterial elves as well as visionary scientists and engineers.

The narrative chronicles the events of a single year, though within tat year are found the events of a lifetime: birth, maturation, aging, death, generosity, meanness, accomplishment and failure.Through subtle yet vivid description, the author draws the reader into a human world that appears so utterly different. However, as the leading characters&#39; lives and perosnal qualities, their joys, hopes and anxieties unfold, the exoticism of their world fades and the experience of life rings strangely familiar. Indeed, the narrative&#39;s power lies in its finely woven depiction of the great commonality of human life and the human condition in the midst of a peculiar and foreign world. If this is an admission anthropologists are traditionally loathe to make, yet it is so; and the reader is left with a beautiful and compelling portrait of a world and a people in which the familiar and the strange freely mix and mingle.</p><p>David P.

Children, parents and grandparents alike will share in this new addition to the family bookshelves!</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense. <p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

In <i>The Visible Word</i>, Johanna Drucker shows how later art criticism has distorted our understanding of such works. She argues that Futurist, Dadaist, and Cubist artists emphasized materiality as the heart of their experimental approach to both visual and poetic forms of representation; by mid-century, however, the tenets of New Criticism and High Modernism had polarized the visual and the literary.<br> <br> Drucker suggests a methodology closer to the actual practices of the early avant-garde artists, based on a rereading of their critical and theoretical writings. After reviewing theories of signification, the production of meaning, and materiality, she analyzes the work of four poets active in the typographic experimentation of the 1910s and 1920s: Ilia Zdanevich, Filippo Marinetti, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Tristan Tzara.<br> <br> Few studies of avant-garde art and literature in the early twentieth century have acknowledged the degree to which typographic activity furthered debates about the very nature and function of the avant-garde. <i>The Visible Word</i> enriches our understanding of the processes of change in artistic production and reception in the twentieth century.</p></p><p></p><h2>Discovering AutoCAD 2017</h2><p>This book presents a hands-on, activity-based approach to the use of AutoCAD as a drafting tool&#x2014;complete with techniques, tips, shortcuts, and insights that improve efficiency.

Their origin, history, and battles. Brief..but informative. This is an expanded version of one of the most popular articles we ever published, the extraordinary history of the Knights of Malta. &#34;The exploits of the Knights of St. John during the Middle Ages are some of the greatest stories of courage, endurance and steadfast devotion to a vision since biblical times. Three times, a small band of a few hundred knights took their stand against the most powerful armies of Islam. Outnumbered by as many as a hundred to one, they vowed not to retreat before the enemies of the cross, and they held their ground. Although they endured some of the most terrible sieges and human wave assaults in the history of warfare, when the smoke cleared, their flag would still be flying. They simply could not be dislodged from the ground that they claimed? Though the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but spiritual, there are great and timely lessons for us to learn from the amazing history of the Order of St. John. Epic battles such as they fought must be waged today in the spiritual realm. Great knights of the Spirit are gathering again, vowing to never retreat before the enemies of the cross.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Money: A History</h2><p>Examines the history of money from the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt to today&#39;s cashless alternatives</p><p><p> <b>Catherine Eagleton</b> is curator of paper money and modern coins in the British Museum. </p><p> <b>Jonathan Williams</b> is curator of Roman and Iron Age coins in the British Museum. </p><p> <b>Joe Cribb</b> is curator of Asian coins in the British Museum. </p><p> <b>Elizabeth Errington</b> is curator of South Asian coins in the British Museum. </p><p><b> Introduction </b></p><blockquote><p> <i>It is easier to write about money than to acquire it; and those who gain it make great sport of those who only know how to write about it.</i><br> - Voltaire, Philosophical Dictionary (1764) </p></blockquote><p> Writing about money can be a hazardous enterprise, and involves treading on sensitive ground. Few phenomena in human history have been the focus of so much constant and fevered attention, occasioned so many moral and religious strictures and been the cause of so much violent strife and competition between individuals and states. This book attempts to describe how this happened, and to give some idea of the reasons why. </p><p> How are we to approach this difficult subject? We might begin by generalizing about human nature, examining the role of money in different cultures and societies from an anthropological perspective. Or we might treat the problem as one of economics, looking at the statistics and general theories which are the basic tools of the economist and the economic historian. The approach taken in this book, however, is neither anthropological nor economic, but historical. Yet this is not simply a traditional history of money from its 'origins' to the present day. Rather it is several histories, broadly chronologically arranged, each investigating money in one of a number of cultures as diverse as ancient India and modern Europe. </p><p> The diversity of the forms of money described in the following chapters necessarily raises the question of general definitions. In the abstract, money is often defined primarily as a means of exchange, while on a concrete level the word refers to those classes of object commonly used to perform this function. As this book, and Chapter 8 in particular will show, definitions such as these are mostly unhelpful, being a reflection of an inherently modem and Western point of view. There is more to the history of money than just buying and selling. </p><p> All the chapters in this book have been written by curators in the Department of Coins and Medals in the British Museum, specialists in particular areas and periods of the history of coinage and paper money. Their responsibilities include the care and presentation of the Museum's collections and the acquisition of new and important pieces. But behind the care of objects -- relics of the past and apparently of interest only to antiquarians and collectors -- lie the particular historical contexts which underpin and explain the bewildering variety of functions and material forms that money has adopted. In the chapters that follow we shall be concerned not only with the objects themselves, but with what people in history have done with money, what they have thought about it and what effects it has had on them. The real history of money lies not in statistics, nor even in numismatics, though both can be found in this book, but in human attitudes and behavior. </p><p> Take, for example, the painting in fig.3. It was produced around 1514 by the Flemish artist Quentin Matsys. The two main characters are husband and wife. He is a money-lender, sitting at a table and carefully weighing a pile of coins. His wife sits on his left and also concentrates on the transaction taking place, while absent-mindedly fingering the book of devotional reading that lies half-open in front of her. There is a third participant in the scene, artfully concealed as a reflection in the mirror standing on the table. We assume that he is the customer of the moneylender, come to conclude a deal. </p><p> On one level, the painting is simply a well-observed scene of daily life in the Netherlands of the early sixteenth century, when trade was booming and the merchants of the Low Countries were among the richest in Europe. But if we look again, we may see it also as a story, a scene from the dramatic narrative of the history of money. Where is the focus of action and attention in the work as a whole? There is no obvious interaction between the couple in the picture, nor between them and us, the viewers. The picture is not primarily about relationships between people. All eyes, ours included, are fixed on the coins being counted out on the table. Money seems to be the focal point of the human world depicted here. As such, it appears to be competing with two other central features of the European society of that period: religion (witness the wife's neglect of her prayer-book) and the sacred bond of matrimony (the money lying on the table draws the married couple's attention away from one another and inexorably towards itself). </p><p> We might possibly conclude from this interpretation that Matsys meant us to understand the work as a fairly straightforward, moralising attack on money, a tirade against its destructive effects on human values. But perhaps this picture is not just a sermon in line and color. It may in fact be considerably more subtle in its implications. After all, the woman may be momentarily looking away from her prayer-book, but she has not abandoned it completely; nor has she entirely left her husband's side for other distractions. A more complex interpretation of the painting might suggest that the artist is attempting to represent the ways in which money, religion and family actually co-exist in the real world, the world of history, rather than depicting a simplistic or moralising opposition between the material world of wealth and the higher realms of spiritual and emotional life. </p><p> The central characters in the painting are looking at a heap of physical objects -- objects which for them meant money. Money, for early fifteenth-century Europeans, was for the most part gold and silver coins, and this fact is important. Other histories of money have perhaps tended not to look very hard at the objects involved, because of an unfortunate divergence in approach between historians and numismatists. In this book, however, coins and other objects will often take center stage. Without them, an account of the history of money would be incomplete. </p><p> A book such as this cannot claim to be comprehensive, but neither is the choice of subjects arbitrary. The emphasis of the chapters will vary according to the nature of the period and culture under discussion, and each will attempt to characterize what is specific to that period or culture, in order to illustrate the immense geographical and chronological variety within the history of money. The first half traces the development of money in the 'Western' tradition, beginning with the civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, where the first written records of monetary and commercial activity have been found, and moving on to the Aegean civilization of the Greeks and to the Mediterranean and continental world of the Roman Empire and medieval Europe. In the subsequent chapters the 'Eurocentric' balance is redressed with a triple focus on the perhaps less familiar histories of the Islamic world, India and China, and a chapter considering the indigenous monies of Africa and Oceania. In the final chapter, however, which looks at the modern world, it has been difficult to avoid considering the subject from an almost exclusively Western point of view. This can largely be justified by the increasing influence of European and, later, American culture on world history as a whole, and on the history of money in particular. The processes of colonialism, the two world wars and the developments in communications and technology which have led to the increasing 'globalization' of the world economy perhaps make this bias inevitable, as the origins of these various factors seem to lie mostly in the West. Modern monetary practices are so firmly rooted in the 'Western' tradition that even in the eastern countries of the Pacific Rim, with their own diverse traditions, Western-style money has been adopted as an integral tool in their ever growing economic power. If money is among the most influential factors shaping humanity in the modern world, then this, perhaps, is a particularly appropriate time to take another look at its history. </p></p><h2>The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan</h2><p>This classic work describes shamanic figures surviving in Japan today, their initiatory dreams, ascetic practices, the supernatural beings with whom they communicate, and the geography of the other world in myth and legend.</p><p><strong>'One of the absolute 'must read' books on Japanese religious practice.

Yet today, when people in organizations are asked to do more with less, be responsive 24/7, and manage in rapidly changing environments, negotiation is more essential than ever. What has been missed in much of the literature of the past 30 years is that negotiations in organizations always take place within a context&#x2014;of organizational culture, of prior negotiations, of power relationships&#x2014;that dictates which issues are negotiable and by whom. When we negotiate for new opportunities or increased flexibility, we never do it in a vacuum. We challenge the status quo and we build out the path for others to negotiate those issues after us. In this way, negotiating for ourselves at work can create small wins that can grow into something bigger, for ourselves and our organizations. Seen in this way, negotiation becomes a tool for addressing ineffective practices and outdated assumptions, and for creating change.</p> <p><i>Negotiating at Work</i> offers practical advice for managing your own workplace negotiations: how to get opportunities, promotions, flexibility, buy-in, support, and credit for your work. It does so within the context of organizational dynamics, recognizing that to negotiate with someone who has more power adds a level of complexity. The is true when we negotiate with our superiors, and also true for individuals currently under represented in senior leadership roles, whose managers may not recognize certain issues as barriers or obstacles.&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<i>Negotiating at Work</i> is rooted in real-life cases of professionals from a wide range of industries and organizations, both national and international.</p> <ul> <li>Strategies to get the other person to the table and engage in creative problem solving, even when they are reluctant to do so</li> <li>Tips on how to recognize opportunities to negotiate, bolster your confidence prior to the negotiation, turn 'asks' into a negotiation, and advance negotiations that get "stuck"</li> <li>A rich examination of research on negotiation, conflict management, and gender</li> </ul> <p>By using these strategies, you can negotiate successfully for your job and your career; in a larger field, you can also alter organizational practices and policies that impact others.</p></p><p><p><b>Praise for NEGOTIATING AT WORK</b></p> <p>"The barriers for women inside businesses can be subtle, and often even invisible.

He moved to Paris in 1921, devoted himself to writing fiction, and soon became part of the expatriate community, along with Gertrude Stein, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ezra Pound, and Ford Madox Ford. He revolutionized American writing with his short, declarative sentences and terse prose. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954, and his classic novella <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1953. Known for his larger-than-life personality and his passions for bullfighting, fishing, and big-game hunting, he died in Ketchum, Idaho, on July 2, 1961.Chapter 1: After the Storm <p>It wasn't about anything, something about making punch, and then we started fighting and I slipped and he had me down kneeling on my chest and choking me with both hands like he was trying to kill me and all the time I was trying to get the knife out of my pocket to cut him loose. Everybody was too drunk to pull him off me. He was choking me and hammering my head on the floor and I got the knife out and opened it up; and I cut the muscle right across his arm and he let go of me. He couldn't have held on if he wanted to. Then he rolled and hung onto that arm and started to cry and I said:</p> <p>"What the hell you want to choke me for?"</p> <p>I'd have killed him. I couldn't swallow for a week. He hurt my throat bad.</p> <p>Well, I went out of there and there were plenty of them with him and some came out after me and I made a turn and was down by the docks and I met a fellow and he said somebody killed a man up the street. I said "Who killed him?" and he said "I don't know who killed him but he's dead all right," and it was dark and there was water standing in the street and no lights and windows broke and boats all up in the town and trees blown down and everything all blown and I got a skiff and went out and found my boat where I had her inside of Mango Key and she was all right only she was full of water. So I bailed her out and pumped her out and there was a moon but plenty of clouds and still plenty rough and I took it down along; and when it was daylight I was off Eastern Harbor.</p> <p>Brother, that was some storm. I was the first boat out and you never saw water like that was. It was just as white as a lye barrel and coming from Eastern Harbor to Sou'west Key you couldn't recognize the shore. There was a big channel blown right out through the middle of the beach. Trees and all blown out and a channel cut through and all the water white as chalk and everything on it; branches and whole trees and dead birds, and all floating. Inside the keys were all the pelicans in the world and all kinds of birds flying. They must have gone inside there when they knew it was coming.</p> <p>I lay at Sou'west Key a day and nobody came after me. I was the first boat out and I seen a spar floating and I knew there must be a wreck and I started out to look for her. I found her. She was a three-masted schooner and I could just see the stumps of her spars out of water. She was in too deep water and I didn't get anything off of her. So I went on looking for something else. I had the start on all of them and I knew I ought to get whatever there was. I went on down over the sand-bars from where I left that three-masted schooner and I didn't find anything and I went on a long way. I was way out toward the quicksands and I didn't find anything so I went on. Then when I was in sight of the Rebecca Light I saw all kinds of birds making over something and I headed over for them to see what it was and there was a cloud of birds all right.</p> <p>I could see something looked like a spar up out of the water and when I got over close the birds all went up in the air and stayed all around me. The water was clear out there and there was a spar of some kind sticking out just above the water and when I come up close to it I saw it was all dark under water like a long shadow and I came right over it and there under water was a liner; just lying there all under water as big as the whole world. I drifted over her in the boat. She lay on her side and the stern was deep down. The port holes were all shut tight and I could see the glass shine in the water and the whole of her; the biggest boat I ever saw in my life laying there and I went along the whole length of her and then I went over and anchored and I had the skiff on the deck forward and I shoved it down into the water and sculled over with the birds all around me.</p> <p>I had a water glass like we use sponging and my hand shook so I could hardly hold it. All the port holes were shut that you could see going along over her but way down below near the bottom something must have been open because there were pieces of things floating out all the time. You couldn't tell what they were. Just pieces. That's what the birds were after. You never saw so many birds. They were all around me; crazy yelling.</p> <p>I could see everything sharp and clear. I could see her rounded over and she looked a mile long under the water. She was lying on a clear white bank of sand and the spar was a sort of foremast or some sort of tackle that slanted out of water the way she was laying on her side. Her bow wasn't very far under. I could stand on the letters of her name on her bow and my head was just out of water. But the nearest port hole was twelve feet down. I could just reach it with the grains pole and I tried to break it with that but I couldn't. The glass was too stout. So I sculled back to the boat and got a wrench and lashed it to the end of the grains pole and I couldn't break it. There I was looking down through the glass at that liner with everything in her and I was the first one to her and I couldn't get into her. She must have had five million dollars worth in her.</p> <p>It made me shaky to think how much she must have in her. Inside the port hole that was closest I could see something but I couldn't make it out through the water glass. I couldn't do any good with the grains pole and I took off my clothes and stood and took a couple of deep breaths and dove over off the stern with the wrench in my hand and swam down. I could hold on for a second to the edge of the port hole and I could see in and there was a woman inside with her hair floating all out. I could see her floating plain and I hit the glass twice with the wrench hard and I heard the noise clink in my ears but it wouldn't break and I had to come up.</p> <p>I hung onto the dinghy and got my breath and then I climbed in and took a couple of breaths and dove again. I swam down and took hold of the edge of the port hole with my fingers and held it and hit the glass as hard as I could with the wrench. I could see the woman floated in the water through the glass. Her hair was tied once close to her head and it floated all out in the water. I could see the rings on one of her hands. She was right up close to the port hole and I hit the glass twice and I didn't even crack it. When I came up I thought I wouldn't make it to the top before I'd have to breathe.</p> <p>I went down once more and I cracked the glass, only cracked it, and when I came up my nose was bleeding and I stood on the bow of the liner with my bare feet on the letters of her name and my head just out and rested there and then I swam over to the skiff and pulled up into it and sat there waiting for my head to stop aching and looking down into the water glass, but I bled so I had to wash out the water glass. Then I lay back in the skiff and held my hand under my nose to stop it and I lay there with my head back looking up and there was a million birds above and all around.</p> <p>When I quit bleeding I took another look through the glass and then I sculled over to the boat to try and find something heavier than the wrench but I couldn't find a thing; not even a sponge hook. I went back and the water was clearer all the time and you could see everything that floated out over that white bank of sand. I looked for sharks but there weren't any. You could have seen a shark a long way away. The water was so cleak and the sand white. There was a grapple for an anchor on the skiff and I cut it off and went overboard and down with it. It carried me right down and past the port hole and I grabbed and couldn't hold anything and went on down and down, sliding along the curved side of her. I had to let go of the grapple. I heard it bump once and it seemed like a year before I came up through to the top of the water. The skiff was floated away with the tide and I swam over to her with my nose bleeding in the water while I swam and I was plenty glad there weren't sharks; but I was tired.</p> <p>My head felt cracked open and I lay in the skiff and rested and then I sculled back. It was getting along in the afternoon. I went down once more with the wrench and it didn't do any good. That wrench was too light. It wasn't any good diving unless you had a big hammer or something heavy enough to do good. Then I lashed the wrench to the grains pole again and I watched through the water glass and pounded on the glass and hammered until the wrench came off and I saw it in the glass, clear and sharp, go sliding down along her and then off and down to the quicksand and go in. Then I couldn't do a thing. The wrench was gone and I'd lost the grapple so I sculled back to the boat. I was too tired to get the skiff aboard and the sun was pretty low. The birds were all pulling out and leaving her and I headed for Sou'west Key towing the skiff and the birds going on ahead of me and behind me. I was plenty tired.</p> <p>That night it came on to blow and it blcw for a week. You couldn't get out to her. They come out from town and told me the fellow I'd had to cut was all right except for his arm and I went back to town and they put me under five hundred dollar bond. It came out all right because some of them, friends of mine, swore he was after me with an ax, but by the time we got back out to her the Greeks had blown her open and cleaned her out. They got the safe out with dynamite. Nobody ever knows how much they got. She carried gold and they got it all. They stripped her clean. I found her and I never got a nickel out of her.</p> <p>It was a hell of a thing all right. They say she was just outside of Havana harbor when the hurricane hit and she couldn't get in or the owners wouldn't let the captain chance coming in; they say he wanted to try; so she had to go with it and in the dark they were running with it trying to go through the gulf between Rebecca and Tortugas when she struck on the quicksands. Maybe her rudder was carried away. Maybe they weren't even steering. But anyway they couldn't have known they were quicksands and when she struck the captain must have ordered them to open up the ballast tanks so she'd lay solid. But it was quicksand she'd...</p></p><h2>Georgian London</h2><p>In this classic of English architectural history (first published more than half a century ago), John Summerson provides a perceptive and highly readable account of a major building period in the history of London. Encompassing the architecture of the capital from the Great Fire of 1666 through the city&#x2019;s early nineteenth-century expansion, the book remains an indispensable guide to the genesis and development of Georgian London. Summerson examines the way in which building was conditioned by social, economic, and financial circumstances and discusses some of Britain&#x2019;s most important buildings and their architects.<br><br>While Summerson&#x2019;s text is essentially unchanged in this edition, it has been corrected in the light of new research, expanded to include a few significant buildings that were originally overlooked, and enhanced with new illustrations.

First, to make Kierkegaard accessible; second, to present in as concise a way possible his "heart," his core themes, and his passion. Divided into six sections, Provocations contains a little of everything from Kierkegaard's prodigious output, including his famously cantankerous (yet wryly humorous) attacks on what he calls the "mediocre shell" of conventional Christianity, his brilliantly pithy parables, and his incisive attempts to dig through the fluff of theology and clear a way for the basics: decisiveness, obedience,and recognition of the truth. <p>Arguably the most accessible Kierkegaard volume to be published in decades, Provocations is a must for every serious reader. Indeed, the wealth of sayings and aphorisms collected in one of the sections is reason enough to buy the book.</p></p><p>The most accessible Kierkegaard reader everS�ren Kierkegaard (1813&#x2013;1855), the Danish philosopher and theologian, is regarded as a father of modern existentialism.

A leader of the Dada movement in Germany, he later joined the circle of writers and artists gathered in Paris around Andr� Breton, the unofficial founder of the Surrealist movement. At the outset of World War II, Ernst fled Germany for the United States, first going to New York and eventually settling in Sedona, Arizona. Ernst returned to Europe in 1950 and continued to explore Surrealist imagery and methods throughout his life.</p><p>This important book accompanies the first retrospective exhibition of Ernst&#x2019;s work held in the United States in thirty years. It examines his pioneering accomplishments in painting, collage, and sculpture and considers his use of the techniques of frottage, grattage, and decalcomania. Also featured are Ernst&#x2019;s unique collage novels--narratives comprising disparate images culled from nineteenth-century engravings and combined in surreal, unsettling compositions. Leading scholars write on various aspects of Ernst&#x2019;s life and art: Werner Spies on Ernst in America; Ludger Derenthal on Ernst and politics; Pepe Karmel on Ernst and contemporary art; Thomas Gaehtgens on Ernst and the old masters; and Robert Storr on the collage novels.</p></p><p><p>Max Ernst, a pivotal figure in the history of twentieth-century art, was an important innovator in the Dada and Surrealist movements.

The scholars and activists featured in this anthology reject this approach as too limiting, insisting that we adopt a view that is both transdisciplinary and multiperspectival. Their essays focus on the components of diversity, social justice, and inclusive excellence, not just within the United States but in other parts of the world. They examine diversity in the contexts of culture, race, class, gender, learned ability and dis/ability, religion, sexual orientation, and citizenship, and explore how these concepts and identities interrelate. The result is a book that will provide readers with a better theoretical understanding of diversity studies and will enable them to see and think critically about oppression and how systems of oppression may be challenged.</p><p><p>At the State University of New York College at Cortland, Seth N.

The author of a popular series of college textbooks on both writing and reading, John enjoys the challenge of developing materials that teach skills in an especially clear and lively way. Before teaching, he earned advanced degrees in writing at Rutgers University and in reading at Rowan University. He also spent a year writing fiction that, he says, is now at the back of a drawer waiting to be discovered and acclaimed posthumously. While in school, he supported himself by working as a truck driver, a machinist, a battery assembler, a hospital attendant, and an apple packer. John now lives with his wife, Judith Nadell, near Philadelphia. In addition to his wife and Philly sports teams, his passions include reading and turning on nonreaders to the pleasure and power of books.

Responding to the &#x201c;increasing mobility of texts,&#x201d; MLA now encourages writers to focus on the process of crafting the citation, beginning with the same questions for any source. These changes, then, align with current best practices in the teaching of writing which privilege inquiry and critical thinking over rote recall and rule-following.</i> </p></p><p><b>George J.

In this new contribution to the anthropology of the state, Yael Navaro-Yashin brings recent poststructuralist and psychoanalytic theory to bear on the study of the political. Delving deeper than studies of nationalist discourse that would focus on consciously articulated narratives of political identity, the author explores sites of "fantasy" in the public-political domain of Istanbul.</p><br><p> The book focuses on the conflict over secularism in the aftermath of an Islamist victory in the city's municipalities. In contrast with studies that would problematize and objectify religious movements, the author examines the agency of secularists under a state widely known for its "secularist" policies. The complexity and dynamism of the context studied moves well beyond scholarly distinctions between "secularity" and "religion," as well as "state" and "society." Here, secularism and Islamism emerge as different guises for a culture of statism where people from "society" compete to claim "Turkish culture" for themselves and their life practices. With this work that stretches the boundaries of regionalism, the author situates her anthropological study of Turkey not only in scholarship on the Middle East, but also in the broader problem of thinking "Europe" anew.</p></p><p><p>"A theoretical tour de force. The author attacks head-on some of the most important, influential social thinkers of the past twenty years. She offers some very important insights in this original and interesting take on this very timely subject. The unpacking of secularist and Islamist discourse is a significant contribution to the body of scholarship about modern Turkey in particular, and by implication to other contexts as well.

The Stakhanovite movement commemorated the mining of 108 tons of coal by Alexi Stakhanov in 1935 and it was an important symbol by which the state urged workers to achieve greater productivity. As Siegelbaum shows, Stakhanovism can be used to explore the social relations within Soviet industry at a critical stage in its development. In this sense, Stakhanovism was an important symbol of a shift in official priorities from construction of the means of production via increasing inputs of labor to intensive use of capital and labor.</p><p>The movement&#39;s significance as a symbol of a shift in official Soviet priorities, from construction of the means of production to intensive use of capital and labor, is emphasized in this analysis."...by far the best entry into the Soviet industrial scene, from above and from below, presented with remarkable competence and good judgement...[Siegelbaum] helps us understand the organization of labour and problems of stimulation; we learn about norm setting and shop-floor foremen; we get a good historical overview of forms of labour organization and 'socialist competition' through the decade that interests him and we should commend him, in particular, for his knowledge of the labour process in the coal mines where Stakhanovism was invented." Moshe Lewin, Labour/Le Travail<br><br>"A short review cannot do justice to the subtlety of insight in evidence throughout this book. In this work, Siegelbaum is generous in his praise of scholars who have influenced him. One can only conclude that Stakhanovism and the Politics of Productivity will itself undoubtedly become a model for future practitioners of Soviet labor history. William B.

Using rich case studies in every chapter, this text provides a succinct framework that will help students to recognize the general patterns in specific case material, to distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and to extend their anthropological understanding to contemporary issues. </p><p> When I was ten years old and living in Middletown, New York, my parents decided to move to Japan. The morning after arriving in Japan, I walked out onto a small street behind the house where we were staying and into a new world. As a man on a motorcycle zipped by, I managed to get out an <i>ohayo gozaimasu</i> ("good morning"). The man had already passed me but he shifted all the way around in his seat and returned the greeting&#x2014;without, as I feared, crashing into the wall along the road. Much of anthropology for me is in that moment: the feel of a different culture's sights, sounds, and smells; language as the key to crossing into that culture; and the sharp pleasure I feel even now whenever I return to Japan and walk down the narrow, twisting side streets I met over forty years ago. </p> <p> When I was twenty-two years old, I was out in the highlands of southern Vietnam. I was an interpreter in Vietnamese and a development specialist for the U.S. army, but I found myself in a minority village working on a gravity-pump water system. A woman motioned me into a house. It was a long house with bamboo matting across sleeping platforms, and smoke curled up through the matting from smoldering fires on the floor. It was the home of the village chief, who was extremely ill. My efforts to teach myself their language (from a Vietnamese text) had not progressed very well, but I was pretty sure that this was malaria. Back in the provincial capital, I managed to convince a Vietnamese medical team to move up their periodic visit to the village. It was indeed malaria and the village chief rapidly recovered. Much of the rest of anthropology for me is in that episode: the ever beckoning image of yet another culture and another language as different from the last as the last was from your own; the involvement in practical issues that are sometimes minor and sometimes life-threatening; the strange world of power where an unimportant outsider could mobilize significant resources to achieve a return to health for an important villager. </p> <p> How do you put that anthropological experience into an academic class? One answer is to use a text and perhaps supplement it with a reader. That approach will work very well in conveying what anthropology has become as a field of study and the range of insights it has produced. Yet, for many of us, the time (and money) spent on such a text divert attention from the heart of the anthropological experience: a connection between the anthropologist and the places and peoples visited. For us, the answer is usually to use a range of case studies that suggest not only the variation in human cultures but also the variation in how we as anthropologists react to those cultures. </p> <p> However, using only case studies has limitations. After all, there are some general insights that anthropologists have gained that help illuminate the specific case material. For those who choose a case-study approach but also want a text that will outline those general insights, the options are relatively few. The full-length texts&#x2014;of which there are many good ones&#x2014;are too time-consuming to permit the incorporation of more than episodic case-study material. Even the mid-length texts&#x2014;of which there are some very good ones&#x2014;are hefty enough to limit their use to courses that will use no more than one or two extended case studies. <i>Cultural Anthropology: Adaptations, Structures, Meanings</i> is designed specifically to meet this gap. It provides a rough guide to the major insights of cultural anthropology that supports such a case-study approach. This is not, then, a text to be-supplemented by other materials but instead is meant to be the supplement itself. </p> <p> The purpose of this text as a supplement affects its length and its structure. This is a very pruned-down, bare-bones approach. There are many places in the book where most anthropologists (including me) would say: "More needs to be said here"; "This needs more attention to other regions"; or "What about the new theoretical approaches used with this subject?" The issue of length prohibits that. This text is for the building blocks, not for the elaboration of them. That's what the other course materials&#x2014;whether ethnographies, monographs, or even fiction&#x2014;are for. </p> <p> Two other aspects of the structure of the book deserve note. First, I have tried to give equal attention to what I see as the three major strands of anthropological interest. One is ecological and is clearest in Part I. One is structural (or institutional) and is clearest in Part II. The last is more strictly "cultural" and is clearest in Part III, with its emphasis on meaning, its construction, and its expression. In giving equal attention to these three strands, I have also tried to keep the discussions separate. Although there is topical overlap among the three parts, I do not attempt to reconcile them into one approach. The ecological sections are thus unabashedly materialistic, the structural sections show all the virtues and limitations of systemic analysis, and the sections on meaning steadfastly refuse to reduce ideational issues to materialist ones. </p> <p> Second, I have tried to be inclusive of the issues of theory, method, and practice as they appear to a wide range of anthropologists. Thus, examples may from time to time be more methodological or more theoretical, more academic or more applied. I have taken a very broad notion of what anthropology is about and a particularly broad notion of culture as a kind of buffer (material, social, and ideational) between human beings as biological entities and the environments in which they live. That inclusiveness is particularly important to me since my own work has been as often in the nonacademic as in the academic world. Much of my own research and writing has been not on people in far-off places but on the contemporary United States. </p> <p> The result of these decisions will not meet the specific needs of all teachers of anthropology but will provide, I hope, a basic framework from which r to begin a foray into the riches of anthropology. Those riches are in the extended case material. This book aims to provide students with a foundation for those more in-depth materials ("If this is an agricultural society, what should I expect?"), encourage their use ("It would be interesting to see how this works out in another society"), and serve as a useful reference when reading them ("Now what was that about matrilineal inheritance?"). </p></p><h2>Practice Test for the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test (NNAT) Grades 3-4 Level D by Mercer Publishing (2008) Paperback</h2><p>Also available in ebook at Mercerpublishing.com ______"Mercer Publishing has the only available practice materials in the format of the NNAT* exam." --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ** Level D of the NNAT is usually given to students in third and fourth grade. ** One of the tools for measuring a student&#x2019;s ability to enter the gifted program is the Naglieri Nonverbal Ability Test* (NNAT*) published by Harcourt Assessment, Inc.

It is the work of a writer at the peak of her powers.</p><p>Jhumpa Lahiri was born in London and raised in Rhode Island. She is the recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, and author of two previous books. Her debut collection of stories,<b> Interpreter of Maladies</b>, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize, the PEN/Hemingway Award and <i>The New Yorker</i> Debut of the Year. Her novel <b>The Namesake</b> was a New York Times Notable Book, a Los Angeles Times Book Prize finalist and was selected as one of the best books of the year by <i>USA Today</i> and <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, among other publications. She lives in Brooklyn, New York.<b>EXCERPT<br>Unaccustomed Earth<br><br></b>After her mother&#x2019;s death, Ruma&#x2019;s father retired from the pharmaceutical company where he had worked for many decades and began traveling in Europe, a continent he&#x2019;d never seen. In the past year he had visited France, Holland, and most recently Italy. They were package tours, traveling in the company of strangers, riding by bus through the countryside, each meal and museum and hotel prearranged. He was gone for two, three, sometimes four weeks at a time. When he was away Ruma did not hear from him. Each time, she kept the printout of his flight information behind a magnet on the door of the refrigerator, and on the days he was scheduled to fly she watched the news, to make sure there hadn&#x2019;t been a plane crash anywhere in the world.<br><br>Occasionally a postcard would arrive in Seattle, where Ruma and Adam and their son Akash lived. The postcards showed the facades of churches, stone fountains, crowded piazzas, terra-cotta rooftops mellowed by late afternoon sun. Nearly fifteen years had passed since Ruma&#x2019;s only European adventure, a month-long EuroRail holiday she&#x2019;d taken with two girlfriends after college, with money saved up from her salary as a para- legal. She&#x2019;d slept in shabby pensions, practicing a frugality that was foreign to her at this stage of her life, buying nothing but variations of the same postcards her father sent now. Her father wrote succinct, impersonal accounts of the things he had seen and done: &#x201c;Yesterday the Uffizi Gallery. Today a walk to the other side of the Arno. A trip to Siena scheduled tomorrow.&#x201d; Occasionally there was a sentence about the weather. But there was never a sense of her father&#x2019;s presence in those places. Ruma was reminded of the telegrams her parents used to send to their relatives long ago, after visiting Calcutta and safely arriving back in Pennsylvania.<br><br>The postcards were the first pieces of mail Ruma had received from her father. In her thirty-eight years he&#x2019;d never had any reason to write to her. It was a one-sided correspondence; his trips were brief enough so that there was no time for Ruma to write back, and besides, he was not in a position to receive mail on his end. Her father&#x2019;s penmanship was small, precise, slightly feminine; her mother&#x2019;s had been a jumble of capital and lowercase, as though she&#x2019;d learned to make only one version of each letter. The cards were addressed to Ruma; her father never included Adam&#x2019;s name, or mentioned Akash. It was only in his closing that he acknowledged any personal connection between them. &#x201c;Be happy, love Baba,&#x201d; he signed them, as if the attainment of happiness were as simple as that.<br><br>In August her father would be going away again, to Prague. But first he was coming to spend a week with Ruma and see the house she and Adam had bought on the Eastside of Seattle. They&#x2019;d moved from Brooklyn in the spring, for Adam&#x2019;s job. It was her father who suggested the visit, calling Ruma as she was making dinner in her new kitchen, surprising her. After her mother&#x2019;s death it was Ruma who assumed the duty of speaking to her father every evening, asking how his day had gone. The calls were less frequent now, normally once a week on Sunday afternoons. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re always welcome here, Baba,&#x201d; she&#x2019;d told her father on the phone. &#x201c;You know you don&#x2019;t have to ask.&#x201d; Her mother would not have asked. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re coming to see you in July,&#x201d; she would have informed Ruma, the plane tickets already in hand. There had been a time in her life when such presumptuousness would have angered Ruma. She missed it now.<br><br>Adam would be away that week, on another business trip. He worked for a hedge fund and since the move had yet to spend two consecutive weeks at home. Tagging along with him wasn&#x2019;t an option. He never went anywhere interesting&#x2014;usually towns in the Northwest or Canada where there was nothing special for her and Akash to do. In a few months, Adam assured her, the trips would diminish. He hated stranding Ruma with Akash so often, he said, especially now that she was pregnant again. He encouraged her to hire a babysitter, even a live-in if that would be helpful. But Ruma knew no one in Seattle, and the prospect of finding someone to care for her child in a strange place seemed more daunting than looking after him on her own. It was just a matter of getting through the summer&#x2014;in September, Akash would start at a preschool. Besides, Ruma wasn&#x2019;t working and couldn&#x2019;t justify paying for something she now had the freedom to do.<br><br>In New York, after Akash was born, she&#x2019;d negotiated a part-time schedule at her law firm, spending Thursdays and Fridays at home in Park Slope, and this had seemed like the perfect balance. The firm had been tolerant at first, but it had not been so easy, dealing with her mother&#x2019;s death just as an important case was about to go to trial. She had died on the operating table, of heart failure; anesthesia for routine gallstone surgery had triggered anaphylactic shock.<br><br>After the two weeks Ruma received for bereavement, she couldn&#x2019;t face going back. Overseeing her clients&#x2019; futures, preparing their wills and refinancing their mortgages, felt ridiculous to her, and all she wanted was to stay home with Akash, not just Thursdays and Fridays but every day. And then, miraculously, Adam&#x2019;s new job came through, with a salary generous enough for her to give notice. It was the house that was her work now: leafing through the piles of catalogues that came in the mail, marking them with Post-its, ordering sheets covered with dragons for Akash&#x2019;s room.<br><br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Adam said, when Ruma told him about her father&#x2019;s visit. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be able to help you out while I&#x2019;m gone.&#x201d; But Ruma disagreed. It was her mother who would have been the helpful one, taking over the kitchen, singing songs to Akash and teaching him Bengali nursery rhymes, throwing loads of laundry into the machine. Ruma had never spent a week alone with her father. When her parents visited her in Brooklyn, after Akash was born, her father claimed an armchair in the living room, quietly combing through the <i>Times</i>, occasionally tucking a finger under the baby&#x2019;s chin but behaving as if he were waiting for the time to pass.<br><br>Her father lived alone now, made his own meals. She could not picture his surroundings when they spoke on the phone. He&#x2019;d moved into a one-bedroom condominium in a part of Pennsylvania Ruma did not know well. He had pared down his possessions and sold the house where Ruma and her younger brother Romi had spent their childhood, informing them only after he and the buyer went into contract. It hadn&#x2019;t made a difference to Romi, who&#x2019;d been living in New Zealand for the past two years, working on the crew of a German documentary filmmaker. Ruma knew that the house, with the rooms her mother had decorated and the bed in which she liked to sit up doing crossword puzzles and the stove on which she&#x2019;d cooked, was too big for her father now. Still, the news had been shocking, wiping out her mother&#x2019;s presence just as the surgeon had.<br><br>She knew her father did not need taking care of, and yet this very fact caused her to feel guilty; in India, there would have been no question of his not moving in with her. Her father had never mentioned the possibility, and after her mother&#x2019;s death it hadn&#x2019;t been feasible; their old apartment was too small. But in Seattle there were rooms to spare, rooms that stood empty and without purpose.<br><br>Ruma feared that her father would become a responsibility, an added demand, continuously present in a way she was no longer used to. It would mean an end to the family she&#x2019;d created on her own: herself and Adam and Akash, and the second child that would come in January, conceived just before the move. She couldn&#x2019;t imagine tending to her father as her mother had, serving the meals her mother used to prepare. Still, not offering him a place in her home made her feel worse. It was a dilemma Adam didn&#x2019;t understand. Whenever she brought up the issue, he pointed out the obvious, that she already had a small child to care for, another on the way. He reminded her that her father was in good health for his age, content where he was. But he didn&#x2019;t object to the idea of her father living with them. His willingness was meant kindly, generously, an example of why she loved Adam, and yet it worried her. Did it not make a difference to him? She knew he was trying to help, but at the same time she sensed that his patience was wearing thin. By allowing her to leave her job, splurging on a beautiful house, agreeing to having a second baby, Adam was doing everything in his power to make Ruma happy. But nothing was making her happy; recently, in the course of conversation, he&#x2019;d pointed that out, too.<br>How freeing it was, these days, to travel alone, with only a single suitcase to check. He had never visited the Pacific Northwest, never appreciated the staggering breadth of his adopted land. He had flown across America only once before, the time his wife booked tickets to Calcutta on Royal Thai Airlines, via Los Angeles, rather than traveling east as they normally did. That journey was endless, four seats, he still remembered, among the smokers at the very back of the plane. None of them had the energy to visit any sights in Bangkok during their layover, sleeping instead in the hotel provided by the airline. His wife, who had been most excited to see the Floating Market, slept even through dinner, for he remembered a meal in the hotel with only Romi and Ruma, in a solarium overlooking a garden, tasting the spiciest food he&#x2019;d ever had in his life as mosquitoes swarmed angrily behind his children&#x2019;s faces. No matter how they went, those trips to India were always epic, and he still recalled the anxiety they provoked in him, having to pack so much luggag...</p><h2>Why Fonts Matter</h2><p><b>Discover the incredible power of fonts to influence your decisions, alter your perceptions, stir your emotions and change how you understand the world.</b> <br><br>We all constantly interact with type in almost every aspect of our lives.

The castle was constructed in the 14th century by the Countess of Villeneuve. Over the centuries it was rebuilt several times. In the 19th century it was turned into a glass factory. In 1918, it was purchased by two Americans, Henry Clews Jr. and Marie Clews (1880-1959), who restored and moved into the castle, and added additional sections in their own personal style, with sculptures by Henry Clews Jr. The castle is owned by the La Napoule Art Foundation, which was founded in 1951 by Marie Clews, and serves as a cultural centre.

Well, maybe not, but all rock bios should start with hyperbole, and if anyone deserves hyperbole, it's Harry. This photo book/biography works wildly well in both its media. Chris Stein's pictures of Harry, Blondie, and the New York rock scene are not only fun in a nostalgic way, they're damn good pictures that you can stare at for hours--even without having taken the drugs that inspired them. And the story of Debbie Harry's life, as written by Harry and rock critic Victor Bockris, is two steps past weird. Who knew that Debbie was a flower child in the '60s and saw the Doors, Janis Joplin and the Velvet Underground live at some of their most celebrated shows? Or what about Debbie's stint in the psychedelic folk band Wind in the Willows? Or that Debbie was 35 years old when Blondie hit it big? Her career crosses and overruns so many moments and people in rock history that reading her bio is like driving through rock &amp; roll heaven. And, frankly, the fact that the book is full of photos of the cutest rock star in history doesn't hurt. A must for fans of Harry and historians of rock. <i>--James DiGiovanna</i><b>Lauren Cowen</b> is an award-winning journalist whose work has appeared in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> , the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> , and other publications. <b>Victor Bockris</b> has written about the cultural heroes of the twentieth century for over thirty years.

My parents lived in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, having moved as youngsters from the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Their parents were Orthodox Jews who had emigrated from Poland at the end of the nineteenth and the beginning of the twentieth century.1 When my mother was pregnant with my brother, Nathan, who is four years younger than me, we moved to the Boro Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, where I grew up and where my parents remained until their deaths. The Boro Park of my youth was a Modern Orthodox community of second-generation Jews. Following the end of World War II, some displaced persons who had survived the Holocaust moved into the neighborhood. The current occupants of Boro Park are Chasidic Jews who have moved from Williamsburg seeking to re-create the shtetels of Eastern Europe. (My daughter Ella and her contemporaries now see Williamsburg as a cool neighborhood--a far cry from the "old country" where grandparents with Yiddish accents lived when I was growing up.)<br><br>My parents grew up in Williamsburg during the peak of the Depression. My mother, Claire, had been a very good student at Eastern District High School, graduating with honors at fifteen and a half. She then enrolled at City College in the fall of 1929--the first of her family to attend college. She was forced by her father's deteriorating economic situation to leave before the end of the semester. She worked as a bookkeeper, earning $12 a week. <br><br>My father, who was not a good student, attended Torah V'Daas--translated as "Bible and Knowledge"--Yeshiva in Williamsburg. He began to work during high school and never attended college.<br><br>My grandparents knew each other from the neighborhood. My grandfathers were both chazanim, cantors, who sang the Jewish liturgy in small synagogues, called shteebles. They were involved in the founding of several Jewish institutions, including a free loan society, a burial society, the Young Israel synagogue, and the Torah V'Daas Yeshiva.2 Their day jobs were typical for their generation of immigrants. Louis Dershowitz sold corrugated boxes. Naphtali Ringel was a jeweler. My grandmothers, Ida and Blima, took care of their children. Each had eight, but two of Blima's died of diphtheria during an epidemic. My mother, Blima's second surviving child, nearly died during the influenza outbreak of 1917, but according to family lore, she was saved by being "bleeded."<br><br>Born toward the end of the Depression and exactly a year to the day before the outbreak of the Second World War, I was the first of more than thirty grandchildren on both sides of my family. <br><br>My maternal grandfather had been married to my grandmother's older sister, who died during childbirth, leaving two children. Pursuant to Jewish tradition, he then married the younger sister, my grandmother Blima, who was fifteen. In the 1930s, he traveled to Palestine by boat. Having little money, he worked as a mashkeach--the person whose job it was to make sure the Kosher food was ritually acceptable--to earn his fare. Once in Palestine, he purchased a small parcel of land on which he someday hoped to build a home, but he quickly realized that he couldn't earn a living there and returned to Brooklyn. Several years later, he suddenly died. Since I was a toddler, I knew him only through family memories and sepia photographs. My grandmother, who still had three unmarried daughters at home, one son in the army, and another in California,3 could not afford to maintain her apartment, so my family moved in and my father paid the rent. We took in a border to help with the expenses, and I shared a room with her. After about a year, we moved to our own small apartment and then to the two-and-a-half-family house in which I grew up.<br><br>My paternal great-grandfather, Zecharja, who was the first of us to arrive in America in 1888, died in 1921 at age sixty-two. His wife, Lea, died in 1941, at age eighty-two, and I vaguely remember her.<br><br>My family has now been in the United States for more than half of our nation's existence. Most of Zecharja's numerous descendants have been very religious and relatively poor, giving rise to the family quip that the Dershowitzes have the lowest rate of wealth to time in America of any Jewish family.4 My grandfather Louis Dershowitz died when I was fifteen (he was seventy-one), so I knew him as a child. Though poor, he was respected for having saved many relatives from the Holocaust, by creating "jobs" for them as rabbis, cantors, ritual slaughterers, and other religious functionaries. The questionable affidavits he had concocted to "make up" these jobs helped to secure visas for twenty-eight of his European relatives, who arrived in America just before the outbreak of the war. A twenty-ninth relative, a young girl who was studying the violin in Poland, was trapped. My grandfather refused to give up on her, sending his oldest, unmarried son--my uncle Menash--into the belly of the beast to find and "marry" her, so she could come to America. Although the marriage was supposed to be a sham, it lasted for more than fifty years, ending with their deaths less than a year apart.<br><br>Both of my grandmothers, Blima and Ida, lived to ripe old ages (Blima into her nineties, Ida into her eighties), and I knew them well. Blima played a significant role in my upbringing, since my mother worked and "Gramma Ringel" was always there to serve me milk and her homemade cookies when I came home from school. <br><br>Among my earliest memories were vignettes from the Second World War, which ended when I was nearly seven. I can see my father pasting on the Frigidaire door newspaper maps depicting the progress of Allied troops. I remember hearing radio accounts, in deep, stentorian voices, from WOR (which I thought spelled "war"), announcing military victories. I can still sing a ditty (sung to the tune of the Disney song from Snow White):<br><br>Whistle while you work<br><br>Hitler is a jerk<br><br>Mussolini is a meanie<br><br>And the Japs are worse5<br><br>The comic books we read during the war always pitted the superheroes against the Nazis and the "Japs," and I wanted to help. I decided that if Billy Batson could turn into Captain Marvel by simply shouting "Shazam!," so could I. And so, after making a cape out of a red towel, I jumped out of the window yelling "Shazam!" Fortunately, I lived on the first floor and I only sustained a scraped knee and a bad case of disillusionment.6 <br><br>When I was four years old, German spies landed on Long Island in a submarine. Although they were quickly captured, there were rumors of other planned landings. If I couldn't help our war effort by turning myself into a superhero, at least I could look out for German spies. Over the next few summers, which my family spent in a rented room near Rockaway Beach, a police officer paid us kids a penny a day to be on the lookout for "Kraut subs." We took our job seriously and spotted a few suspicious objects that turned out to be birds, or flotsam and jetsam.<br><br>I remember both VE (Victory in Europe) and VJ (Victory over Japan) days. There was dancing in the streets, block parties, and prayers. Our soldiers, including several of my uncles, were coming home. (My father received a medical deferment because he had an ulcer, which my mother said was caused by my bad behavior.)7<br><br>We weren't told of the Holocaust or Shoah, just that we had lost many relatives in Europe to Hitler (Yemach Sh'mo--"May his name be erased"). We cheered Hitler's death, which, according to a Jewish joke, we knew would occur on a Jewish holiday--because whatever day he died would be a Jewish holiday!8 <br><br>The "greenies" (recent immigrants, "greenhorns") who moved to Boro Park from the displaced persons camps never talked about what had happened "over there." The tattooed numbers on their arms remained unexplained, though we knew they were dark reminders of terrible events. Even my grandfather rarely talked about the noble role he had played in saving family members, because he knew how many friends had lost relatives in Europe. My maternal grandparents lost nearly all their families, except for one couple who had managed to emigrate to Palestine before the war. <br><br>I grew up in a home entirely free of any racial prejudice. My parents admired black leaders (we called them "Negro" or "colored"). My father, who sold men's work clothing and underwear, had several black customers, whom he treated as equals. My favorite college professor was black. Once every two weeks my mother hired a "cleaning woman" to dust and help her with the house. Some were black. Some were white. A few were Jewish immigrants. The only bigotry I remember was directed against Hungarian Jews by my maternal grandmother. She had obviously brought her prejudice with her from Poland. Following the end of World War II, several Hungarian Jewish families moved into the neighborhood. My grandmother immediately expressed a dislike. I recall her joking about the recipe for a Hungarian omelet: "First steal two eggs!"<br><br>Among my other memories was Israel's struggle for statehood. My family members were religious Zionists. We had blue-and-white Jewish National Fund pushkas ("charity boxes") in our homes, and every time we made a phone call, we were supposed to deposit a penny. We sang the "Jewish National Anthem" ("Hatikvah") in school assemblies. I still remember its original words, before Israel became a state: "lashuv l'eretz avosainv" ("to return to the land of our ancestors"). <br><br>One particular incident remains a painful memory. My mother had a friend named Mrs. Perlestein, whose son Moshe went off to fight in Israel's War of Independence. There was a party to celebrate his leaving. Several months later, I saw my mother crying. Moshe had been killed, along with thirty-four other Jewish soldiers and civilians, trying to bring supplies to a Jewish outpost near Jerusalem. My mother kept sobbing, "She was in the movies, when her son was killed." Israel's war had come home. Everyone in the neighborhood knew Moshe. He had attended my elementary school, played stickball on my block, and was a hero. It was a shared tragedy, and Moshe's death--combined with my mother's reaction to it--had a profound and lasting effect on me.<br><br>My friends and I formed a "club"--really just a group of kids who played ball together. We named it "the Palmach"--after the Israeli strike force that was helping to win the war. We memorized the Palmach anthem, "Rishonim, tamid anachnu tamid, anu, anu Hapalmach." ("We are always the first, we are the Palmach.")<br>Vignette <br><br>Vidal Sassoon<br><br>Several years ago, I spoke to a Jewish group in Los Angeles, and among the guests were David Steinberg (the comedian) and the late Vidal Sassoon (the style master). Steinberg mentioned to me that when Sassoon was young, he fought for the Palmach. (If you think that seems unlikely, consider that "Dr. Ruth" Westheimer served as a sniper in the same war.) I challenged Sassoon to sing the Palmach anthem, and before you knew it, Sassoon and I were loudly belting out the Hebrew words to the amusement of the other surprised guests.<br>Israel declared statehood in May 1948, when I was nine years old. Following its bold declaration that after two thousand years of exile, there has arisen a Jewish state in the Land of Israel (supported by the United Nations, the United States, the Soviet Union, and most Western nations), the nascent state was attacked by the armies of the surrounding Arab countries. One out of every hundred Israeli men, women, and children were killed while defending their new state--some in cold blood, after surrendering. Many of those killed had managed to survive the Holocaust. That summer I went to a Hebrew-speaking Zionist summer camp called Massad (where the counselor in an adjoining bunk was Noam Chomsky, then a fervent left-wing Zionist). We heard daily announcements regarding the War of Independence. We sang Israeli songs, danced the hora, and played sports using Hebrew words (a strike was a shkeya, a ball a kadur).<br><br>Shortly after Israel defended itself against the Arab attacks, we learned of a new threat to the Jewish people: Stalin's campaign against Jewish writers, politicians, and Zionists. Stalin became the new Hitler as we read about show trials, pogroms, and executions of Jews. We hated Communism almost as much as we hated fascism. We were also frightened of the threat posed by the Soviet Union, with its atomic arsenal. Our school made us practice running to the "shelter" in the event of a nuclear attack. During my latter years in elementary school, I wrote the following poem: <br><br>Engines all around us roaring with steam<br><br>Powerfull [sic, powerful] bombers and jets that gleam<br><br>Sources [sic, saucers] in the skyline, vechels [sic, vehicles] on earth<br><br>Atomic energy surrounding us from birth<br><br>Medical wonders, and scientific news<br><br>Wonderfull [sic, wonderful] progress, we hope to never loose [sic, lose]<br><br>But someday, in the future when energy turns to bombs<br><br>Atoms spliting [sic, splitting] all around us recking [sic, wrecking] homes and farms.<br><br>Someday in the future we shall be in the past.<br><br>Without electric bulbs to warm us--and without the funsets [sic, furnace's] blast.<br><br>These early memories contributed significantly to my emerging ideology and worldview. My family's politics were liberal, Zionist, and anti-Communist. Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and Mayor La Guardia were our heroes. <br><br>Although there were plenty of discussions about current events, politics, and religion, our home had few books, little music, no art, no secular culture. My parents were smart but had no time or patience for these "luxuries." Our apartment was modest--the ground floor of a two-and-a-half-family house. The upstairs was rented to my uncle, aunt, and their two children, while the finished basement was rented to my cousin and her husband, who had recently been discharged from the army. We lived in two small bedrooms, the smaller of which I shared with my brother. We ate in the kitchen. My mother's dream, never realized, was to have "a real dining room." The living room, which had the mandatory couch covered with plastic, was reserved for guests (who were rare). The tiny bathroom was shared by the four of us. The foyer doubled as a dining area for Shabbos meals. The total area was about one thousand square feet. But we had an outside--and what an outside it was! In the front there was a small garden and a stoop. In the rear we had a tiny back porch, a yard, and a garage. Since we had no car, we rented the garage to another cousin, who used it to store the toys he sold wholesale.</p><h2>So Little Time (Mail Order Bride #9)</h2><p>Romance and revulsion, distance and determination frame a story that spans the continent in the late 1800s. McClain Reardon had saved ten-year-old Rya&#39;s life when the fugitive John Wilkes Booth held her at gunpoint in Virginia. Reuniting with McClain years later on the wagon trail to California, lovely Rya falls in love with her lifelong hero, and they plan to get married. But there is one dark shadow on this bright future: a sore old suitor&#39;s merciless harassment. Even though the Reardons have found true love, separation seems unavoidable.

Moore and Gillette teach men how to use their masculine energy to empower themselves and live richer, fuller, more satisfying lives.</p><p>This last volume of four (The Magician Within, p. 208, etc.) from Jungian psychoanalyst Moore and mythologist Gillette completes a vision of the mature man as a noble, emotionally generous, artistically expressive soul. Here, stating that all men are ``wired for loving, and for mystical experience,'' the authors consider why this is such a difficult ``energy'' for most men to master. They agree with men's movement luminary Robert Bly on the importance of a father to a boy's psychological development and on the connection between impaired adult instincts and early loss or deprivation: ``What determines the mode of a man's loving [monogamy, promiscuity, etc.] involves the ways in which he was wounded and affirmed as a boy.'' Men can struggle to avoid shadow behaviors and learn to use techniques to access the ``Lover within''--techniques including some form of play every day (to honor ``the Child within''); expressive activities (especially dance); and the development of capacities for spiritual experience. In this view of the authentic lover's ideal, a romantic involvement is central, not to find the lost elements or repressed parts of a man's life--though failure to do so sours a relationship--but to share what Harville Hendrix calls a ``passionate friendship'' (a friendship with, the authors add, a spiritual dimension). Shorter and less burdened by elaborate distinctions than the previous books--and offering a more streamlined roundup of background examples and fewer of those murky philosophical passages that erect barriers where there should be bridges. But even so, it's a dense and weighty read. (Fifty b&amp;w photos, eight pages color photos--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In this final volume in the four-book series that began with The King Within , Jungian analyst Moore and mythologist Gillette, a counselor, examine the Lover archetype within the male psyche (the others are the King, the Warrior, and the Magician--each examined in a previous volume). The authors trace how the Lover--the feeling side of men's nature--gives rise to passion, creativity and the pursuit of pleasure. Through the Lover's energy, the conscious mind may encounter the personal and collective unconscious. However, the authors contend, because many men fear being consumed--and thus emasculated--by the Lover's energy, they suppress their feelings and creative instincts. At the opposite extreme, a man can become possessed by the Lover, which then manifests itself as an addictive personality (whether to alcohol, drugs, food or relationships). A potpourri of Jungian theory and mythology, with anecdotes from Moore's workshops and private practice, this book attempts to show men how to get in touch with their inner Lover and use its energies without becoming consumed by them.

But he is also a slave. And when fate presents him with the opportunity to throw off his shackles once and for all, he becomes the leader of a revolutionary army of slaves determined to free all of his brethren across Atlantis.</p><p>Harry Turtledove&#x2014;the <b>New York Times</b> bestselling author of numerous alternate history novels, including <b>The Guns of the South, How Few Remain</b>, and the <b>Worldwar</b> quartet&#x2014;has a Ph.D. in Byzantine history. Nominated numerous times for the Nebula Award, he has won the Hugo, Sidewise, and John Esthen Cook Awards. He lives with his wife and children in California.*Starred Review* Followers of Turtledove&#x2019;s Atlantis trilogy (Opening Atlantis, 2007; The United States of Atlantis, 2008; and this book) won&#x2019;t be surprised that it concludes with an Atlantean Civil War. Nor will those familiar with Turtledove&#x2019;s oeuvre be surprised that his expertise on the American Civil War makes the third book the trilogy&#x2019;s best. To get a this-world fix on its animating conceit, imagine that Nat Turner was George Washington&#x2019;s mulatto grandson, who, threatened with death, determined to be free and raised a formidable slave army. Such is what Frederic Ratcliff does in Atlantis, where the Slave Power isn&#x2019;t as formidable as the American South was and racism isn&#x2019;t as strong. Ratcliff and his Native American general, Lorenzo, face a respectable professional army led by hard-bitten Balthasar Sinapis, a European exile with a mysterious past. At the nominal head of that army on alternating days are pro-slavery consul Jeremiah Stafford and his anti-slavery partner, Leland Newton. Political bickering, effective guerrilla tactics, and unfamiliar terrain lead to a situation in which the army must negotiate peace or be slaughtered. Then the light dawns on both parties that fighting to decisive victory or defeat will ruin Atlantis for everyone. The Treaty of Slug Hollow is hammered out and presented to the Senate. More obstacles remain, and the Senate offers a mixture of horror-struck opposition, hair-tearing doubt, and sighs of relief. In the end, readers may, overwhelmingly, join in joyously launching their hats skyward. --Roland Green</p><h2>Chainbreaker&#39;s War: A Seneca Chief Remembers the America</h2><p>An authentic, eyewitness account by a Seneca warchief of the American Revolution.

Homocysteine is quickly broken down by certain B vitamins, so it isn&#39;t usually a problem. But if a person isn&#39;t getting enough of these B vitamins (a widespread and disturbing problem in our country today), then homocysteine builds up to dangerous levels and &#34;burns&#34; the delicate tissue of artery walls. Plaque is then formed at the site of this inflammation as the body attempts to heal the damage. How dangerous is this? Studies show that a high level of homocysteine is one of the most dangerous risk factors for heart disease. It increases a person&#39;s risk of heart attack by 300 percent! If you&#39;re thinking a little extra B-vitamin intake would correct the problem, you&#39;re on the right track. That&#39;s exactly how some alternative M.D.s handle the problem. Studies as far back as 1988 show that this B vitamin lowers homocysteine levels back into the safety zone in just weeks. It has an 80% success rate. And the cost is about 5 cents a day. The secret thyroid connection But if you&#39;re a good detective (and I think you are), you&#39;re probably wondering what&#39;s causing this B-vitamin deficiency in the first place? Closer investigation reveals that an underactive thyroid gland is at the root of the problem. This malfunction inhibits the absorption of B vitamins, causing homocysteine levels to skyrocket. The connection between the thyroid and heart disease was first mentioned in the 1976 book, Solved: The Riddle of Heart Attacks, by Dr. Broda Barnes. His research was largely ignored by the medical community, until the release of a study in 1999. At the Cleveland Clinic, researchers corrected the thyroid function in patients and saw homocysteine levels normalize on their own-without any need for vitamins.</p><p></p><h2>Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era: Identification and Value Guide</h2><p>Shows goblets, plates, trays, pitchers, vases, and tea cups made by a variety of American manufacturers during the 1920s and 1930s</p><p>A collector since childhood, Gene Florence's hobby of buying and selling glassware turned into a full-time career.

It waits in a forgotten chamber in Sandcliff Palace, the abandoned Larion Senate stronghold on Eldarn's North Sea. The spell table holds the power to see the people of the 5 lands safely through the oppression and brutality that have haunted them for generations, but without Lessek's key it is a worthless slab of granite. &nbsp;Unfortunately for Steven Taylor&#x2014;the would-be sorcerer from Colorado&#x2014;he overlooked the nondescript key the night he fell through the far portal into Eldarn. Now Steven must race across American to retrieve the key and free Eldarn's people rests, but Nerak&#x2014;the fallen Larion dictator&#x2014;is hot on his heels.

The story moves along briskly, though Mark's sudden racial sensitivity and expert archer Garec's crisis of conscience are jarring diversions.

Arranged by geographical regions, each state is allocated two to four pages. Each chapter has a small map that shows the location of that state in the country and a larger map of the state that locates the places mentioned in the text. Some chapters have simple activities. Each chapter contains an eclectic collection of trivia and other information that has no relationship to the text. "Lights, Camera, Action!" boxes describe some far-fetched methods for remembering capital cities. The text is sometimes wordy, and the sentence structure is awkward. Though the copyright page claims that the information is accurate to the best of the authors' knowledge, readers who are familiar with their home states may find some errors. For example, Kansas contains inaccurate statements about sunflower seeds and a rather glib discussion of tornadoes. Some of the riddles about famous people could be useful for classroom activities, but there are enough flaws here to make this a questionable purchase.<br><i>Eldon Younce, Harper Elementary School, KS </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Exploring Jewish Ethics: Papers on Covenant Responsibility</h2><p><p>Is a post-modern liberal Jewish ethics possible? Can the personal freedom today's Jews cherish have an effective role in a life shaped by the claims of Jewish law and tradition? </p><p>For more than twenty years, a renowned Jewish thinker has been giving a positive answer to these questions. In the forty papers gathered here, some being published for the first time, Eugene Borowitz rejects the forced choice of either anarchic liberalism or Orthodox legal discipline, halakhah, to create a new approach to Jewish ethics. </p><p>The enterprise of modern Jewish ethics, he shows, arose in the nineteenth century in optimistic response to emancipation from the<br>ghetto. But after the Holocaust and the general disillusion with the moral character of modernity, the old confidence in humankind's rationality seems ludicrous. As a result, many<br>have gladly surrendered the self to an orthodoxy only to discover it can lead to zealotry or fanaticism. </p><p>Borowitz agrees that modern democracy needs a religious foundation but insists it, too, has compelling spiritual insight, most notably in its reverence for individual dignity and group tolerance. Integrating the truths of modernity and tradition, he formulates an ethics of the autonomous Jewish self living in Covenant. His free Jew is intimately bound to the Jewish people-its present community, its past tradition, its messianic future-and to its God, the One who still grounds Jewish duty<br>and summons Jews to their responsibilities.</p><p>Borowitz applies his ethical approach to problems as diverse as marital sexuality, capitalism's temptations, psychotherapy,<br>leadership styles, the continuing claims of social justice, confidence in government, homosexuality, the Jewish version of imitatio dei, and more. Religion itself comes within his purview and he breaks new ethical ground in trenchant analyses of intra-Jewish relationships and theological inter-faith dialogue with Buddhists as well as Christians.</p><p>Readers will be informed, aroused, even angered by some of these papers. They will also be ethically edified by engagement with a thinker who gives the mind full due while living more fundamentally in Jewish faith. Responding to his ideas, they will face anew what they believe and must now do to maintain the Covenant.</p></p><p>An exploration of the personal freedom of today&#39;s Jews and the role it plays in shaping the claims of Jewish law and tradition.Eugene B. Borowitz, an ordained rabbi, holds doctoral degrees from Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion and from Columbia University. He is currently Sigmund L.

By Bradbury's own admission, he was influenced by movies from the age of three, and the book traces the shape of this influence through his long career. It also tracks how the visual media have represented Bradbury's work, ranging from the fanzine drawings that appeared before WWII, through the covers of the magazines in which his short stories were published and illustrations for the stories themselves, to the jacket art for nearly 50 years of hardcover and paperback books. Add to that posters and scenes from the many films based on his stories and the diary of making Fahrenheit 451 by director Francois Truffaut-and still there's more. Bradbury, who worked with EC Comics when one of their editors was William Gaines, the future founder of Mad, has had a long association with the stage, and is an above-average artist in his own right, as one short chapter here proves. Weist, a comics expert and artist, has ransacked memories, interviews, correspondences and art collections for the clear text and the well-reproduced artwork in this valuable supplement to other documentation of Bradbury's illustrious career.

So is her dream. Lucy Lowell is referred to Alex by Los Angeles police detective Milo Sturgis. A juror at the agonizing trial of a serial killer, Lucy survived the trauma only to be tormented by a recurring nightmare: a young child in the forest at night, watching a strange and furtive act.<br><br>Now Lucy&#x2019;s dream is starting to disrupt her waking life, and Alex is concerned. The power of the dream, its grip on Lucy&#x2019;s emotions, suggests to him that it may be more than a nightmare. It may be the repressed childhood memory of something very real. Something like murder.</p><p>Twenty-five-year-old Lucy Lowell comes to see Dr. Alex Delaware after the trauma of serving as a juror on a serial-murder case. Since the guilty verdict she has been tormented by a recurring nightmare -- child in the forest at night, watching a strange and furtive burial. The dream is so real, its grip on Lucy's emotions so strong, that Alex wonders if it may be the repressed memory of something very real: a murder. For Alex and his patient, a session of hypnotic regression will be the start of a journey to frightening truth, as Alex finds a link between the dream and Lucy's famous father, once a literary giant, now a recluse. When Lucy insists someone is trying to kill her, Alex must determine whether her fears are self-induced, or whether a flesh-and-blood killer is desperate to eliminate the final witness.

His people are wild rice growers, and the annual harvest has as much spiritual meaning for his people as the raising of corn, beans, and squash does for the Hopi and the Seneca. Glen is taking part in the ritual for the first time and is worried that he won't be strong enough to push the canoe through the rice beds without tipping over. As in Woods's A Boy Becomes a Man at Wounded Knee (Walker, 1992) and Keegan's Pueblo Boy (Dutton, 1991), readers are introduced to the modern Indian world through the experiences of an individual young person. Ojibway history and descriptions of the reservation are smoothly blended into the narrative as Glen learns how to harvest, parch, winnow, and cook the rice. There is a lot of information here, and readers will gain much from it and the many well-chosen, full-color photographs of the Jackson family.

But in the 1920s, leasing companies realized they could contract with shippers to pass back usage payments beyond some agreed minimum. This led to an explosion of car leasing and, as this book amply demonstrates, a corresponding explosion of billboard decoration of refrigerator cars. Railroad objections, especially to the usage payment rebates, led to hearings before the Interstate Commerce Commission, which, taking effect in 1937, banned most of the leasing practices which had generated the car leasing bonanza. After World War II, a restrained billboard style made a modest comeback. Car-side advertising was only a detail of that ICC decision. But because it was the basis for a remarkable diversity of refrigerator car paint schemes in the era, the photographs of these cars have long held an interest for historians, railfans, and model railroaders Thoroughly documented here are hundreds of these paint schemes, together with details of the leasing companies and car builders associated with the individual cars. More than 440 photographs, most previously unpublished, enrich this book. Even a modest amount of color information was available and is included. The authors, both recognized authorities on railroad freight car history, have done a superb job of collecting and organizing the information presented here. The book is sure to appeal to modelers and to many who are interested in railroad history.</p><p></p><h2>THE RED TENT.</h2><p>THE RED TENT. [paperback] Diamant, Anita. [Jan 01, 2001]</p><p>The red tent is the place where women gathered during their cycles of birthing, menses, and even illness. Like the conversations and mysteries held within this feminine tent, this sweeping piece of fiction offers an insider's look at the daily life of a biblical sorority of mothers and wives and their one and only daughter, Dinah. Told in the voice of Jacob's daughter Dinah (who only received a glimpse of recognition in the Book of Genesis), we are privy to the fascinating feminine characters who bled within the red tent. In a confiding and poetic voice, Dinah whispers stories of her four mothers, Rachel, Leah, Zilpah, and Bilhah--all wives to Jacob, and each one embodying unique feminine traits. As she reveals these sensual and emotionally charged stories we learn of birthing miracles, slaves, artisans, household gods, and sisterhood secrets. Eventually Dinah delves into her own saga of betrayals, grief, and a call to midwifery.<p> "Like any sisters who live together and share a husband, my mother and aunties spun a sticky web of loyalties and grudges," Anita Diamant writes in the voice of Dinah. "They traded secrets like bracelets, and these were handed down to me the only surviving girl. They told me things I was too young to hear. They held my face between their hands and made me swear to remember." Remembering women's earthy stories and passionate history is indeed the theme of this magnificent book. In fact, it's been said that <i>The Red Tent</i> is what the Bible might have been had it been written by God's daughters, instead of her sons. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>Anita Diamant is the author of the novels <i>Good Harbor</i>, <i>The Last Days of Dogtown</i> and <i>Day After Night</i>, a collection of essays, <i>Pitching My Tent</i>, as well as six books about contemporary Jewish life, including <i>The New Jewish Wedding</i> and <i>Choosing a Jewish Life: A Guidebook for People Converting to Judaism</i>. Diamant grew up in Newark, New Jersey, and Denver, Colorado. She has a bachelor&#x2019;s degree from Washington University in St. Louis and a master&#x2019;s in English from the State University of New York at Binghamton.

Now, in her wise and perceptive new book, <i>Imperfect Control,</i> she shows us how our sense of self and all our important relationships are colored by our struggles over control: over wanting it and taking it, loving it and fearing it, and figuring out when the time has come to surrender it. <br> Writing with compassion, acute psychological insight, and a touch of her trademark humor, Viorst invites us to contemplate the limits and possibilities of our control. She shows us how our lives can be shaped by our actions and our choices. She reminds us, too, that we sometimes should choose to let go. And she encourages us to find our own best balance between power and surrender.</p><p>Whose life is not impacted, if not defined, by issues of control? Judith Viorst, author of bestselling <i>Necessary Loses</i> and the recipient of various awards for her journalism and psychological writings, cobbles an answer from a variety of sources--the works of biological and social scientists, psychoanalysts, philosophers, personal stories, and her own inimitably fresh point of view. Control--our lack of it, our desire to exercise it, our dread of it--is an omnipresent detail of humanity. Still, we cling to the belief in our freedom to get where we're going: our personal control. And what, in this age of <i>it's in the genes</i>, does control mean, exactly? <p> Citing adoption studies and twin research, Viorst asks--given all the factors that predispose individuals to certain behaviors--what can we reasonably expect to control? She scrutinizes control as it pertains to sex, marriage, parenthood, and workplace dynamics. In the engaging chapter "The Power of Sex," for example, she argues how control is drastically different for women than for men, debunking some powerful myths about male sexuality. The inquiry builds to that experience over which we possess the least amount of control: death. Viorst entreats us to regard our finitude consciously, particularly in relation to lives "heroically" prolonged in the final throes of terminal illness. She also addresses the issue of physician-assisted suicide, offering moving examples that bear witness to "the comfort of that control." Fascinating, funny, and insightful, <i>Imperfect Control</i> invites readers to seek the balance between power and surrender.</p>Judith Viorst is the author of the beloved <i>Alexander and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day</i>, which has sold some four million copies; the Lulu books, including <i>Lulu and the Brontosaurus</i>; the <i>New York Times </i>bestseller <i>Necessary Losses</i>; four musicals; and poetry for children and young adults. Her most recent books of poetry include <i>What Are You Glad About? What Are You Mad About? </i>and <i>Nearing Ninety</i>.</p><h2>The 13th Valley</h2><p>A work that has served as a literary cornerstone for the Vietnam generation, The 13th Valley follows the strange and terrifying Vietnam combat experiences of James Chelini, a telephone-systems installer who finds himself an infantryman in territory controlled by the North Vietnamese Army.

He lives in New York City with his family.</p>"In my long and checkered career I have been witness to, party to, and even singularly responsible for any number of screw-ups, missteps, and over-reaches. I am not Alain Ducasse. The focus of my career has not always been a relentless drive towards excellence. As a mostly journeyman chef, knocking around the restaurant business for twenty-eight years, I&#x2019;ve witnessed some pretty ugly episodes of culinary disaster. I have seen an accidentally glass-laden breaded veal cutlet cause a customer to rise up in the middle of a crowded dining room and begin keening and screaming with pain as blood dribbled from his mouth. I&#x2019;ve watched restaurants endure mid-dinner rush fires, floods rodent infiltration&#x2014;as well as the more innocuous annoyances of used band-aids, tufts of hair, and industrial staples showing up in the Nicoise salad. Busboy stabbing busboy, customer beating up customer, waters duking it out on the dining room floor&#x2014;I&#x2019;ve seen it all. But never have a I seen such a shameful synergy of Truly Awful Things happen, and in such spectacular fashion, as on New Years Eve 1991, a date that surely deserves to live in New York restaurant infamy..."--Anthony Bourdain, "New Years Meltdown" <p>"After looking at the fries, the chef decided that I had cheated, making them the day before and stashing them in the walk-in. I assured him that I hadn&#x2019;t cheated. In fact, I invited him to walk across the kitchen where he could see the evidence of freshness for himself: the spent potato peels, still in the garbage can. But he didn&#x2019;t want to hear this. He so didn&#x2019;t want to hear it that he call me a name he had never called me before: navvy. To this day, I&#x2019;m not sure what it means. But when he called me that, a hush fell over the restaurant staff, as though Marco had just slapped me with his gloves and I was supposed to challenge him to a duel..." --Mario Batali, "The Last Straw" </p><p>"My chef and I were charged with making one dish that night: Smoked salmon served with a thin sliver of avocado terrine. To make the terrine, you prepared a b�chamel, then folded in an avocado puree. The mixture was poured into a mold and a gelatinous liquid was poured over it. It was then refrigerated so the gelatin would set up and suspend the beautiful puree. My chef took the salmon for himself and assigned me the terrine. Eagerly, I went to get some gelatin from the supply room, but discovered that all they had was the powdered variety. Having only used sheet gelatin, I turned the package over to read the instructions. On the back of the box there were what I&#x2019;m sure were very helpful tips, written in not one but three languages: German, French, and Italian. This was about the time when I realized that this wasn&#x2019;t going to be my day..."--Marcus Samuelsson, &#x2018;The Big Chill"</p></p><h2>The White Lady (Grace Livingston Hill Series)</h2><p>Book by Hill, Grace Livingston</p><p>GRACE LIVINGSTON HILL (1865 1947) is known as the pioneer of Christian romance.

Caretakers at the London Zoo were the first to notice it at around 4 a.m. Standing on one of the Hub&#x2019;s football pitches at the north end of the park, the figure, or robot, bears a resemblance, in both size and shape, to the UN robot we now know as Themis. This new giant, however, appears to be a man, or shall I say is made in the image of a man. It is much more muscular than the slender feminine titan that visited London less than a year ago, perhaps taller as well. Its colour is also different, a lighter grey than the UN robot, and it is striated with yellow light, in contrast to the turquoise-veined Themis.<br><br>According to early witnesses, the robot appeared out of thin air in the middle of the park. &#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t there, then it was,&#x201d; said one of the zookeepers. Fortunately, the football pitches at the Hub were deserted at this hour, and not a single casualty has been reported. It is unknown, of course, whether this early appearance was deliberate, as we do not know where this robot came from or who sent it. If this is indeed a robot like Themis, and if it is controlled in the same manner as she is, there could be pilots aboard. If pilots there are, are they Russian, Japanese, or Chinese? Or are they from somewhere else entirely? We can only speculate at this juncture. There might be no one at all in this giant structure. In the four hours it has been standing here, it has not moved an inch.<br><br>The Earth Defense Corps (EDC) has yet to issue an official statement. Dr. Rose Franklin, head of the scientific division, was reached in Geneva, where she was to give a speech later this morning. She would not speculate as to the origin of this second robot but has assured us that it is not part of the UN planetary defence. If true, this would suggest that either a second alien robot has been discovered on Earth and kept from us or that this one does not come from our planet. In New York, the EDC has scheduled a press conference for three o&#x2019;clock London time.<br><br>The Earth Defense Corps, which was founded nine years ago by the United Nations following the American discovery of the Themis robot, is tasked with extracting new technologies from the alien artifact for the benefit of mankind and to protect this planet against extraterrestrial threats. Only time will tell if we are facing such a threat today.<br><br>No word yet from His Majesty&#x2019;s Government, but sources say the Prime Minister will address the nation within the hour. The British people will not have to wait to hear from the other side of the aisle. The official opposition was quick to issue a statement earlier today, immediately calling for the Prime Minister to offer some reassurances. Opposition leader Amanda Webb took to the air about an hour ago, saying: &#x201c;There is an alien device with potentially devastating power standing in the middle of London and all the Prime Minister has seen fit to do is to restrict access to one city park. Can he tell the thirteen million people who live in the Greater London Area that they are safe? If he can, he owes the British people an explanation, and if he can&#x2019;t, I for one would like to know why we aren&#x2019;t talking about evacuation.&#x201d; The former Foreign Secretary went on to suggest that Central London be evacuated first, something that, by her calculation, could be accomplished in an orderly manner in less than forty-eight hours.<br><br>Londoners, for their part, appear in no hurry to go anywhere. Perhaps as surprising as the robot&#x2019;s appearance is the utter nonchalance the population has displayed since. The towering figure is visible from most of London, and while one might expect civic unrest, or a massive exodus from the city, Londoners, for the most part, have gone about their business; many have even made their way towards Regent&#x2019;s Park to see this new titan up close. The police have closed off the area south of Prince Albert and north of A501 between A41 and Albany Street, but some have managed to escape their attention and found their way into the park. The police even had to evacuate a family that was preparing for a picnic, a mere few steps from the giant metallic feet of the intruder.<br><br>It&#x2019;s hard to blame Londoners for seeing a creature similar to Themis as a friendly figure. They have been told that a race of aliens left her on Earth for our protection. Her metal face and backwards legs are on the telly almost every day and have made the front page of every red top for nearly a decade. There are Themis tee shirts for sale on every corner, and young Londoners have grown up playing with Themis action figures. Themis is a star. Her visit to another one of London&#x2019;s Royal Parks a year ago felt more like a rock concert than first contact with something from an alien world.<br><br>This is a defining moment in the short history of the EDC. The fruit of a very fragile coalition, the organization has been called a public-relations stunt by its detractors. Many have argued that a single robot, no matter how powerful, could not defend a planet against an invader. By adding a second robot to its arsenal, or forging a formal alliance with another race, the EDC would come a long way in silencing its critics.<br><br>File No. 1399<br><br>Personal Journal Entry&#x2014;Dr. Rose Franklin, Head of Science Division, Earth Defense Corps<br><br>I had a cat. For some reason, no one remembers my having a cat. I&#x2019;ve been picturing her curled into a ball on the kitchen floor, slowly starving to death while waiting for me to come home. I keep forgetting that Rose Franklin came home that night, that she&#x2014;the other me&#x2014;never left. I&#x2019;m glad my cat didn&#x2019;t starve, but part of me wishes she&#x2019;d waited for me by the door. I miss her. My apartment feels incredibly empty without her small presence.<br><br>Maybe she died. She wasn&#x2019;t that old, though. Maybe I got rid of her when my job became too demanding. Maybe she didn&#x2019;t recognize the person who came home that night pretending to be me and ran away. I wish. She&#x2019;d probably be afraid of me if she were still around. If there&#x2019;s a &#x201c;real&#x201d; Rose Franklin, chances are I&#x2019;m not it.<br><br>Thirteen years ago, I got into a traffic accident on my way to work. Strangers pulled me out of my car and I woke up on the side of the road, in Ireland, four years later. I hadn&#x2019;t aged a day.<br><br>How is that possible? Did I travel to the future? Was I . . . frozen, cryogenized for four years? I&#x2019;ll probably never know. I can live with that. What I&#x2019;m having a hard time dealing with is that I wasn&#x2019;t really gone for those four years. I&#x2014;someone like me, anyway&#x2014;was here. Rose Franklin went to work the next day. She did a whole bunch of things during those years. Somehow, she ended up studying the giant metal hand I had fallen onto as a child. She became convinced that there were more giant body parts lying around and devised a method for unearthing them. She pieced together a giant alien robot called Themis. Then she died.<br><br>It was a busy four years.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t remember any of it, of course. I wasn&#x2019;t there. Whoever did all those things died. I know for a fact it wasn&#x2019;t me me. Rose Franklin was twenty-eight when she was put in charge of the research team studying the hand. She died at thirty. A year later, they found me. I was twenty-seven.<br><br>Themis ended up with the United Nations. They created a planetary defense branch, called the EDC, with the robot as its main asset. I wasn&#x2019;t there for that either. One of me had died. The other hadn&#x2019;t been found yet. They put me in charge of the EDC research team about a month after I reappeared. The other Rose must have made quite an impression because I was probably the least qualified person for the job. I had never even seen Themis. As far as I was concerned, the last time I had seen any part of her was on my eleventh birthday. They didn&#x2019;t seem to care. Neither did I. I really wanted the job. I&#x2019;ve been at it for nine years. Nine years. One would think that would be enough time to get over what happened to me. It&#x2019;s not. I had four years of catching up to do, and that kept my mind busy for a while. But as I settled into some sort of routine, got more comfortable with my new job, my new life, I became more and more obsessed with who and what I am.<br><br>I realize that if I did travel through time, I probably don&#x2019;t have the knowledge to fully understand it, but there shouldn&#x2019;t have been two of us. Move an object from point A to point B, logic dictates you won&#x2019;t find it at point A anymore. Am I a clone? A copy? I can live without knowing what happened to me, but I have to know if I&#x2019;m . . . me. That&#x2019;s an awful thing to doubt.<br><br>I know I don&#x2019;t belong here, now. I&#x2019;m . . . out of sync. It&#x2019;s a familiar feeling, now that I think about it. Every so often&#x2014;maybe two or three times a year&#x2014;I would get this anxiety rush. I&#x2019;d usually be really tired, maybe had too much coffee, and I&#x2019;d start feeling . . . I never knew how to describe it. Every second that goes by feels like nails on a chalkboard. It usually lasts a minute or two but it feels like you&#x2019;re just a tiny bit&#x2014;half a second or so&#x2014;out of sync with the universe. I was never able to really explain it, so I don&#x2019;t know if I&#x2019;m the only one who ever felt this. I suppose not, but that&#x2019;s how I feel every minute of every day now, only that half second is getting longer and longer.<br><br>I have no real friends, no real relationships. The ones I have are based on experiences I didn&#x2019;t share, and the ones I lost have been damaged by events I didn&#x2019;t live through. My mother still calls me every other night. She doesn&#x2019;t understand that we hadn&#x2019;t spoken in over a year when I came back. How could she? She&#x2019;s calling that other person, the one who isn&#x2019;t still dealing with her father&#x2019;s loss, the one who everyone liked. The one who died. I haven&#x2019;t talked to any of my old friends from school, from home. They were at my funeral. That&#x2019;s such a perfect ending to a relationship, I wouldn&#x2019;t want to spoil that.<br><br>Kara and Vincent are the closest thing I have to friends now, but even after nine years, I&#x2019;m somewhat . . . ashamed of our friendship. I&#x2019;m an impostor. Their affection for me is based on a lie. They&#x2019;ve told me what we supposedly went through together and we all pretend that we would have shared the same experiences had the circumstances been different. We keep pretending I&#x2019;m that other person, and they like me for it.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know what I am, but I know I&#x2019;m not . . . her. I&#x2019;m trying to be. Desperately trying. I know that if I could just be her, everything would be all right. But I don&#x2019;t know her. I have gone over every page of her notes a thousand times, and I still can&#x2019;t see the world as she did. I see glimpses of myself in some of her journal entries, but those fleeting moments aren&#x2019;t enough to bring us any closer. She was clever, though; I&#x2019;m not certain I could do what she did if we were looking for giant body parts today. She must have found some research I don&#x2019;t know about, probably something that was published while I was &#x201c;away.&#x201d; Maybe I&#x2019;m an imperfect copy. Maybe she was just smarter.<br><br>She certainly was more optimistic. She believed&#x2014;was utterly convinced&#x2014;that Themis was left here as a gift for us to find in due time, a coming-of-age present left to an adolescent race by a benevolent father figure. Yet they buried all the pieces in the far corners of the Earth, in the most remote of places, even under the ice. I can see why I might get excited by a treasure hunt, but I can&#x2019;t find a good reason for the added hurdles. My gut tells me these things were hidden . . . well, just that. Hidden, as if not to be found.<br><br>More than anything, I can&#x2019;t imagine why anyone, however advanced, would leave behind a robot that, in all likelihood, we wouldn&#x2019;t be able to use. Anyone with the technology to build one of these things, and to travel light-years to bring it here, would have had the power to adapt the controls to our anatomy. They would have had a mechanic aboard, someone who could fix the robot, or at least MacGyver their way out of small problems. All it would really take is their version of a screwdriver to turn the knee braces around so we could use them. They couldn&#x2019;t have expected us to mutilate ourselves in order to pilot this thing.<br><br>I&#x2019;m a scientist, and I have no proof for any of this, but neither did the other Rose when she assumed the opposite. Without evidence, even Occam&#x2019;s razor should never have led me in that direction.<br><br>The irony is that they built this entire program based on my findings. If I had told them how scared I am of what will come, they never would have given me the freedom to do what I&#x2019;m doing now. The lab is the only place I find comfort in and I&#x2019;m grateful for that. I&#x2019;m grateful for Themis, to be in her company every day. I feel drawn to her. She isn&#x2019;t of this world either. She doesn&#x2019;t belong here any more than I do. We&#x2019;re both out of place and out of time, and the more I learn about her, the closer I feel to understanding what really happened to me.<br><br>I know everyone is worried about me. My mother told me she would pray for me. You don&#x2019;t do that for someone who&#x2019;s doing great. I didn&#x2019;t want to upset her, so I said thank you. My faith has never been really strong, but even if it were, I know there&#x2019;s no God coming to help me. There&#x2019;s no redemption for what I&#x2019;ve done. I should be dead. I died. I was brought back by what I assume is advanced technology, but you might as well call it witchcraft. Not too long ago, the Church would have burned someone like me.</p><h2>Daily Life in Ancient and Modern Mexico City (Cities Through Time)</h2><p>A historical exploration of events and daily life in Mexico City in both ancient and modern times</p><p>Grade 3-6In these books, the authors trace life from ancient times through the present. Chapters in Rome are grouped by eras (Early Republic, Late Republic and Early Empire, Late Empire, Middle Ages, Renaissance, Modern Times) while Mexico City separates chapters by historical periods (Beginnings, the Aztecs, Spanish Colonization, Independence, A Modern City). The writing is straightforward and concise, but provides more detail than would be found in most encyclopedias. Emphasis is on the cultural aspects of daily life, whether the topic is slavery in Rome or the ecological issues raised by the 1986 earthquake in Mexico City. Each subtopic is accorded a double-page spread, usually with one page devoted to a reproduction of a painting, a historical photograph, or an original drawing. Webbs pen-and-ink and watercolor artwork is detailed but flat, so it is less successful than the archival images. There are no pronunciation guides, which is particularly disappointing in Mexico City. Purchase these titles where there is interest or for curriculum support.Jeanette Larson, Texas State Library, Austin <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Alley Oop: The Complete Sundays Volume 1 (1934-1936)</h2><p>Introducing the first in a series that will collect, in chronological order, all the Sunday pages of this popular newspaper strip!

He has written numerous biographies (including the internationally best-selling <i>I Am Zlatan Ibrahimovi&#x107;,</i> for which he was the ghostwriter) and four novels, including <i>Fall of Man in Wilmslow </i>and the #1 best-selling <i>The Girl in the Spider's Web.</i>Chapter 1<br> June 12<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Lisbeth Salander was on her way back to her cell from the gym and the showers when she was stopped in the corridor by the warden. Alvar Olsen was blathering on about something, gesticulating wildly and waving a set of papers. But Salander could not hear a word he said. It was 7:30 p.m.<br> &nbsp;<br> That was the most dangerous time at Flodberga Prison. Seven-thirty p.m. was when the daily freight train thundered past; the walls shook and keys rattled and the place smelled of sweat and perfume. All the worst abuses took place then, masked by the racket from the railway and in the general confusion just before the cell doors were shut. Salander always let her gaze wander back and forth over the unit at this time of day and it was probably no coincidence that she caught sight of Faria Kazi.<br> &nbsp;<br> Faria was young and beautiful, from Bangladesh, and she was sitting in her cell. From where Salander and Olsen stood, all Salander could see was her face. Someone was slapping Faria. Her head kept jerking from side to side, though the blows were not that hard&#x2014;there was something almost routine about them. It was clear from Faria&#x2019;s humiliated expression that the abuse had been going on for a long time and had broken her will to resist.<br> &nbsp;<br> No hands were raised to try to stop the slapping, and in Faria&#x2019;s eyes&nbsp;there was no indication of surprise, only a mute, dull fear. This terror was part of her life. Salander could see that just by studying her face, and it matched what she had observed during her weeks at the prison.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Will you look at that,&#x201d; she said, pointing into Faria&#x2019;s cell.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> But by the time Olsen had turned to look, it was over. Salander disappeared into her own cell and closed the door. She could hear voices and muffled laughter in the corridor and outside the freight train clanging by, shaking the walls. She stood in front of the shiny washbasin and narrow bed, the bookshelf and desk strewn with pages of her quantum mechanical calculations. Did she feel like doing more work on loop quantum gravity theory? She realized she was holding something and looked down at her hand.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> It was the same sheaf of papers that Olsen had been waving around, and that did, after all, make her a little curious. But it was some sort of rubbish with coffee cup rings all over the cover page: an intelligence test. Ridiculous. She hated to be prodded and measured.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She dropped the papers which spread like a fan on the concrete floor. For a brief moment they vanished from her mind as her thoughts went back to Faria Kazi. Salander had not seen who was hitting her. But she knew perfectly well who it was. Although at first prison life had not interested Salander, reluctantly she had been drawn in, decoding the visible and invisible signals one by one. By now she understood who called the shots.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> This was called the B Unit, the secure section. It was considered the safest place in the institution, and to a visitor that might have been how it seemed. There were more guards, more controls and more rehabilitation programmes here than anywhere else in the prison. But anyone who took a closer look would realize there was something rotten about the place. The guards put on an act, exuding authority, and they even pretended to care. But in fact they were cowards who had lost control, and they had ceded power to their chief antagonists, gang leader Benito Andersson and her mob.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> During the day Benito kept a low profile and behaved like a model prisoner, but after the evening meal, when the inmates could exercise or&nbsp;receive visits, she took over. At this time of day her reign of terror was uncontested, just before the doors were locked for the night. As the prisoners roamed between cells, making threats and promises in whispered tones, Benito&#x2019;s gang kept to one side, their victims to the other.<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> The fact that Salander was in prison at all was a major scandal. But circumstances had hardly been on her side, nor had she put up a very convincing fight. The interlude seemed absurd to her, but she also thought she might just as well be in jail as anywhere else.<br> &nbsp;<br> She had been sentenced to two months for unlawful use of property and reckless endangerment in the dramatic events following the murder of Professor Frans Balder. Salander had taken it upon herself to hide his eight-year-old autistic son and refused to cooperate with the police because she believed&#x2014;quite rightly&#x2014;that the police investigation had been betrayed. No-one disputed that she went to heroic lengths to save the child&#x2019;s life. Even so, Chief Prosecutor Richard Ekstr�m led the case with great conviction, and the court ultimately found against her, although one of the lay judges dissented. Salander&#x2019;s lawyer, Annika Giannini, had done an outstanding job. But she got virtually no help from her client, so that in the end Salander did not stand a chance. She maintained a sullen silence throughout the trial and refused to appeal the verdict. She simply wanted to get the business over with.<br> &nbsp;<br> At first she was sent to Bj�rng�rda G�rd open prison, where she had a lot of freedom. Then new information surfaced, suggesting there were people who wanted to harm her. This was not entirely unexpected, given the enemies she had made, so she was transferred to the secure wing at Flodberga.<br> &nbsp;<br> Salander had no problem sharing space with Sweden&#x2019;s most notorious female criminals. She was constantly surrounded by guards, and no assaults or violence had been reported in the unit for many years. Records also showed that an impressive number of inmates had been rehabilitated. But those statistics all came from the time before the arrival of Benito Andersson.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> ...<br> &nbsp;<br> From the day Salander arrived at the prison, she faced a variety of provocations. She was a high-profile prisoner known from media coverage, not to mention the rumours that spread through the underworld. Only a few days earlier, Benito had put a note in her hand which read: friend or enemy? Salander had thrown it away after a minute&#x2014;it took about fifty-eight seconds before she could be bothered to read it.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She had no interest in power struggles or alliances. She concentrated on observing and learning, and by now she felt she had learned more than enough. She stared blankly at her bookshelf, stocked with the essays on quantum field theory she had ordered before she landed inside. In the cupboard on the left were two changes of prison clothes, all stamped with the initials of the prison service, plus some underwear and two pairs of sneakers. There was nothing on the walls, not a single reminder of life on the outside. She cared no more for the surroundings in her cell than those in her home on Fiskargatan.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Cell doors were being shut along the corridor and normally that meant some freedom for Salander. When the noise died down, she could lose herself in mathematics&#x2014;in attempts to combine quantum mechanics with the theory of relativity&#x2014;and forget the world around her. But tonight was different. She was irritated, and not just because of the abuse of Faria Kazi or the rampant corruption in the unit.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She could not stop thinking about the visit six days earlier from Holger Palmgren, her old guardian from the time when the authorities had decided she was incapable of taking care of herself. The visit had been a major production. Palmgren was entirely dependent on home aides and assistants and hardly ever left his apartment in Liljeholmen. But he had been adamant. The social service&#x2019;s subsidized transport service brought him in his wheelchair, as he wheezed into an oxygen mask. Salander was glad to see him.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She and Palmgren had spoken of old times and he had become sentimental and emotional. There was just one thing that troubled Salander. Palmgren told her that a woman by the name of Maj-Britt Torell had&nbsp;been to see him. She used to be a secretary at St. Stefan&#x2019;s psychiatric clinic for children, where Salander had been a patient. The woman had read about Salander in the newspapers and brought Palmgren some documents which she believed he might find interesting. According to Palmgren it was more of the same old horror stories about how Salander had been strapped to her bed in the clinic and subjected to the worst kind of psychological abuse. &#x201c;Nothing you need to see,&#x201d; he said. Still, something must have stood out, because when Palmgren asked about her dragon tattoo and the woman with the birthmark, he said:<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wasn&#x2019;t she from the Registry?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The Registry for the Study of Genetics and Social Environment in Uppsala? I thought I read that somewhere.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The name must have been in those new documents,&#x201d; she said.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You think so? Perhaps I&#x2019;m just muddling it all up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Perhaps he was. Palmgren had grown old. Yet the information stuck in Salander&#x2019;s mind. It had gnawed at her while she trained on the speedball in the gym in the afternoons and worked in the ceramics workshop in the mornings. It gnawed away at her now as she stood in her cell looking down at the floor.<br> &nbsp;<br> Somehow the I.Q. test which lay spread across the concrete no longer seemed irrelevant, but rather a continuation of her conversation with Palmgren. For a moment Salander could not grasp why. Then she remembered that the woman with the birthmark had given her all kinds of tests in those days. They always ended in arguments and eventually with Salander, at the age of just six, escaping into the night.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet what was most striking about these memories was not the tests or her running away, but the growing suspicion that there was something fundamental about her childhood she did not understand. She knew she had to find out more.<br> &nbsp;<br> True, she would soon be outside again and free to do as she wanted. But she also knew she had leverage with Warden Olsen. This was not the first time he had chosen to turn a blind eye to abuses, and the unit he headed, still a source of pride in the prison service, was in a state of moral&nbsp;decay. Salander guessed she could get Olsen to give her access to something no-one else in the prison was allowed&#x2014;an Internet connection.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She listened for sounds in the corridor. Muttered curses could be heard, along with doors being slammed, keys rattling and footsteps tapping off into the distance. Then silence fell. The only noise came from the ventilation system. It was broken&#x2014;the air was stifling, unbearable&#x2014;but still humming away. Salander looked at the papers on the floor and thought about Benito, Faria Kazi and Alvar Olsen&#x2014;and the woman with the fiery birthmark on her throat.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> She bent to pick up the test, sat down at the desk and scribbled out some answers. Then she pressed the intercom button by the steel door. Olsen picked up after a long interval, sounding nervous. She said she needed to talk to him right away.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;It&#x2019;s important,&#x201d; she said.</p><h2>Essential Joinery: The Fundamental Techniques Every Woodworker Should Know</h2><p><p><strong>With the knowledge of only a handful of essential joints, a woodworker can build anything he can imagine...</strong></p> <p>Whether it&#x2019;s a kitchen cabinet or an 18th century highboy, the foundation for all types of woodworking can be boiled down to a handful of essential joinery skills.

Soon <i>they'll</i> be shouting, "What time is it, Mr. Crocodile?"<br></p><p><b>JUDY SIERRA </b>is the author of many popular books for children, including<i> Monster Goose</i> and <i>Counting Crocodiles</i>. She lives in northern California.<br><br><b>DOUG CUSHMAN </b>is the author-illustrator of more than eighty books for children, including the Aunt Eater mystery series and <i>What Dads Can't Do</i> and <i>What Moms Can't Do</i>. He lives in Paris.<br>PreSchool-Grade 3&#x2013;Two picture-book talents join forces for some memorable monkey business in this entertaining tale. In the introductory spread, Mr. Crocodile lays out his intended schedule for the next day, but his best-laid plans go awry when the monkeys arrive. Sierra again demonstrates her considerable storytelling skill with a series of deftly rhymed answers to the repeated title question: "Time to take a quick look/for a recipe book./HURRY UP! HURRY UP!/I've got monkeys to cook." Although the story is vaguely reminiscent of several folktales involving cross crocodiles and mischievous monkeys, Mr. Crocodile ultimately shows a soft spot that compromises his traditionally sinister persona. The story ends with him revising his daily planner to reflect his new attitude toward the simian smart alecks. Cushman departs from his signature style of watercolor cartoons in favor of a more sophisticated impressionistic technique using vivid acrylics. This bolder, brighter medium and method depict the action and hilarity even more effectively than his past work. The details, of course, make all the difference, such as the inclusion of a clock in each full-bleed spread with the time corresponding to Mr. Croc's original schedule. Pair this with Sierra's <i>Counting Crocodiles</i> (Gulliver, 1997) for even more fun with this reptilian rogue and his pesky primate counterparts, or with Joan M. Lexau and Cushman's <i>Crocodile and Hen</i> (HarperCollins, 2001) for another tale of a crocodile befriending his intended dinner.<i>&#x2013;Sean George, Memphis-Shelby County Public Library &amp; Information Center, Memphis, TN</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

An unconventional aristocrat who managed to survive the French Revolution, Custine lived openly for most of his life with his partner, Edouard Sainte-Barbe, and wrote a series of unextraordinary books. But after a trip to Russia, he wrote unflinchingly of the fear, violence, and despotism there and thereby achieved fame. Today, many critics consider La Russie en 1839 one of the best books ever written about Russia, offering insights that are both emotional, rational, and prophetic of the Stalin regime. Muhlstein, who won the French Prix Goncourt for this biography in 1996, quotes liberally from Custine's letters and writings, revealing much about the man who became a prominent opponent to abuses of political, social, and moral authority. Highly recommended for public and academic libraries.ARobert Kelly, Fort Wayne Community Schs., IN <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Performing Set: The Broadway Designs of William and Jean Eckart</h2><p>The large-scale Broadway musical is one of America's great contributions to world theatre. Bill and Jean Eckart were stage designers and producers at the peak of the musical, and their designs revolutionized Broadway productions. At a time when sets were meant to remain simply backdrops that established time and place but not much else, an Eckart set became part of the performance on stage, equal at times to an actor. Anyone who has seen <i>Phantom of the Opera</i> or <i>Les Miserables</i> has seen the innovations that the Eckarts brought to the large Broadway-style musical production. They were best known for their designs for <i>Damn Yankees</i> (1955); <i>Once Upon a Mattress</i> (1959), in which Carol Burnett made her Broadway debut; and <i>Mame</i> (1966) with Angela Lansbury.<p> Andrew B. Harris uses production stills and the Eckarts' sketches from every show they worked on to illustrate the magic behind an Eckart design. This lavishly illustrated book, with more than 500 full-color illustrations, is a fitting tribute to both the great American theatre and the couple who helped make it great.<br><br> "Chock full of new and valuable information and which in my opinion will be an important book on the history of the American musical.

Rather than surrender, 86,000 Communists embarked on an epic flight to safety. Only thirty were women. Their trek would eventually cover 4,000 miles over 370 days. Under enemy fire they crossed highland awamps, climbed Tibetan peaks, scrambled over chain bridges, and trudged through the sands of the western deserts. Fewer than 10,000 of them would survive, but remarkably all of the women would live to tell the tale. <br><br><em>Unbound</em> is an amazing story of love, friendship, and survival written by a new master of adventure narrative.</p><p>Dean King is the author of the national bestseller <em>Skeletons on the Zahara</em>. He has written for many publications, including <em>Men's Journal</em>, <em>Esquire</em>, <i>Garden &amp; Gun, Granta, <em>Outside</em></i>, <em>New York Magazine</em>, and the<em> New York Times</em>. He lives in Richmond, Virginia."King spent five years traveling the length of the Long March, interviewing those women still alive to tell their tales. Theirs are stories of courage, remarkable not only because of the physical and psychological rigors of their journey, but also because of their determination... China has always been a mysterious and secretive empire, but <i>Unbound</i> peels back the curtain to reveal a story of strength and survival."<i> </i> (<b><em>Bookpage </em></b> <i><b>John T. Slania</b></i>)<br><br>"Fascinating....King, the best-selling author of <i>Skeletons on the Zahara</i>, has done brilliant work bringing the march to life with a plethora of vivid, well-researched details...<i>Unbound</i> is an authoritative account of the Long March, but its evocations of the marchers' experiences will linger long after the historical details slip from readers' memories." (<b><em>The Richmond Times-Dispatch</em></b> <i><b>Doug Childers</b></i>)<br><br>"<i>Unbound</i> recounts the amazing journey that 30 women and 86,000 men took in an effort to escape Chaing Kai-shek's advancing soldiers...Threading the narratives of the women's individual stories, women's place in China at the time, and the progress of the March with an overall picture of modern Chinese history, King gives readers a unique look at a turning point for [China]. (<b><em>The Houston Press</em></b> <i><b>Olivia Flores Alvarez</b></i>)<br><br>"Dean King's book is deeply researched, drawing from first-person accounts of survivors, Chinese historians and a range of historical scholarship, much of it never before translated into English...Never idealizing the story of the soldiers, <i>Unbound</i> renders, with thrilling precision, their fear and uncertainty." (<b><em>The New Haven Advocate</em></b> <i><b>Nora Nahid Khan</b></i>)<br><br>"A terrific feminist story and a significant document of this incredible human feat." (<b><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></b>)<br><br>"<i>Unbound</i> is a relentless, gripping story of superhuman endurance, of a refusal to accept defeat...King's book is an exhaustive and excellent study of these women and their hard road to equality and freedom...These women, whose blood and sweat helped build a modern nation, truly walked the walk." (<b>Fredericksburg.com</b> <i><b>Howard Owen</b></i>)<br><br>"King gets to the heart of one of history's greatest adventures. He captures the blood, guts and occasional glory of the Chinese Revolution. This is a remarkable tale, by turns thrilling, inspiring and heartbreaking."<br><br> (<b>co-author of <em>The Long March</em></b> <i><b>Ed Jocelyn</b></i>)<br><br>"From his multi-faceted title, <i>Unbound,</i> to the final paragraph, Dean King has produced a highly readable, alive and touching story of a remarkable journey in China in the 1930s. Focusing on women who were on the Long March with the Red Army, the author brings alive the personalities and experiences of those who marched a distance similar to crossing the US from San Francisco to New York and back. The women carried the wounded from battles and skirmishes, fought, climbed, scrambled up and waded through the diverse terrain, sometimes pregnant and often under enemy fire. <i>Unbound</i> will appeal to every reader who likes history that is exciting, accessible and full of the stories of people who perform extraordinary acts of heroism and endurance. How wonderful that this bit of Chinese history is brought to us in such a riveting and personal way." (<b>author of <i>Choosing Revolution: Chinese Women on the Long March</i></b> <i><b>Helen Praeger Young</b></i>)<br><br>"King's book differs from earlier works on this subject in that it does not try to include too many historical details but concentrates on telling the story. He has succeeded in given just enough background information to provide a genuine and moving account of the women who went on the Long March. His story-telling skill coupled with a vivid, flowing style makes the reading of this book an enjoyable experience."
